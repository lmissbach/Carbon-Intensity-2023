\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

% Setting the scene: Understanding distributional impacts are important because they matter to people.
We have come to understand that many people judge a policy by its distributional implications. One reason is that the distribution of policy-induced costs among households can influence aggregate public perception and thus the political feasibility of policy reforms. In the context of climate change mitigation, unintended and heterogeneous policy impacts on households can constrain the implementation of efficient and effective mitigation policies, such as carbon pricing or abolishing fossil fuel subsidies \autocite{MaestreAndres.2019,Dechezlepretre.2022}.

% Setting the scene 2: Why it is important to understand the distributional impacts of climate policy --> design of transfers.
In theory, this does not need to be, since complementing climate policy with (targeted) compensation measures could help to achieve any distribution of costs that is desirable. In practice, however, different frictions impede effective compensation, such as existing distortions in the tax system (REF) or limited institutional capability (REF). % Not sure if this is too much detail here
Moreover, it is often difficult to understand which compensation measure would be effective in achieving which distribution of costs \textit{post}-compensation, because a comprehensive understanding of how policy costs distribute among different households is lacking.

% Research question
In this study, we analyze the heterogeneous impacts of climate policy on households within 87 countries. Transgressing traditional analyses of vertical and horizontal heterogeneity, we use supervised machine learning to disentangle the non-linear contribution of household characteristics that correlate with and drive the carbon intensity of consumption on a country-level. We argue that households' carbon intensity of consumption gives an accurate representation about the additional cost burden of climate policy, at least for any policy instrument that increases the marginal cost of emitting CO$_{2}$.

% Such distributional impacts of climate policy instruments depend on many aspects\footnote{One important aspect is industries' and households' ability to substitute carbon-intensive inputs and consumption goods and services, which determines their responsiveness to regulation.}. In the short-term, firms and households can expect additional relative costs in accordance to their specific carbon intensity. For households, it is possible to infer on the approximate cost burden for any climate policy instruments, that directly or indirectly increase the marginal cost of emitting CO$_{2}$, by inspecting the household-specific carbon intensity of consumption, which expresses the amount of CO$_{2}$-emissions linked to the consumption of goods and services per unit of expenditure.

% \begin{itemize}
  %\item Homogenized, cross-country evaluation based on microdata and household-level characteristics is missing.
  %\item Identification of non-linear relationships insufficient with existing approaches.
  %\item Improving targeting precision: Learning how more and less carbon-intensively consuming households differ from each other can help to design compensation measures that minimize target error. Also, enabling cross-country learning.
  %\item As we show, often-proposed lump-sum transfers insufficient, because of large horizontal heterogeneity. Progressive results do not necessarily mean that all poorer people receive compensation.
  % \item Important paragraph: One important metric that helps assessing the impacts of climate policy is the carbon intensity of consumption or production. For households, the carbon intensity expresses the amount of CO$_{2}$-emissions that link to the consumption of consumed goods and services per unit of expenditure. The carbon intensity of consumption gives an accurate approximation of the cost burden resulting from any policy instrument that directly or indirectly increases the price of CO$_{2}$-emissions.
  %\item Households that consume more carbon-intensive than others spend relatively more money on carbon-intensive goods and services, such as transport fuels, heating fuels, cooking fuels, or electricity.
  %\item Evidence suggests many socio-economic socio-demographic characteristics to drive or correlate with more carbon-intensive consumption.
  % One paragraph outlining the research gap
  %\item Ex-ante economic assessments often focus on single-country or -policy contexts or aggregated cross-country analyses. What is missing is a systematic cross-country analyses with detailed household-level information.
  %\item Systematization of differences to motivate revenue recycling schemes. Cross-country learning, policy learning. Systematizing to enable interpretation.
% \end{itemize}

% One paragraph sketching findings
We show that horizontal differences in carbon intensity exceed vertical differences and that differences in total household expenditures are often an insufficient predictor for differences in carbon intensity. In general, household-level carbon intensity can be difficult to predict in some countries, but models perform well in others. Important household characteristics for predicting carbon intensity beyond household expenditures include vehicle ownership, information about space and energy use, such as cooking and heating fuels or appliance ownership. Our results point to country- and policy-specific distributional impacts, which call for compensation measures tailored to each country-context, if households should be effectively reimbursed for additional costs. 

% One paragraph outlining contribution
Our contribution to a more comprehensive assessment of heterogeneous impacts of climate policy is threefold: First, we describe a novel and homogenized dataset on household-level carbon intensity of consumption. Our dataset contains granular information on 1.5 million single households representative for more than 5 billion people in 87 countries. In contrast, prior work often focuses on single country-contexts or neglects within-country particularities on the household-level. Second, we use supervised machine learning to detect non-linear relationships between household characteristics and carbon-intensity of consumption, while the (nascent) literature investigating horizontal heterogeneity primarily centers on linear models. Third, we identify different clusters of countries based on model outcomes. Countries in the same cluster are more similar to each other with respect to factors associated to the heterogeneity of carbon intensity. This approach helps to understand similarities and differences between the country-specific characteristics of distributional impacts more systematically, thereby enabling cross-country learning. 

%\item Our analysis informs further research on potential drivers of carbon emissions and inequality in carbon-intensive consumption. It might inform policy to develop international, but also national complementary measures to combat unintended effects of effective climate mitigation policies.

% Roadmap paragraph ?
We proceed as follows: In the next chapter \ref{sec:literature}, we revisit the literature on vertical and horizontal distributional impacts of climate policy and point to a knowledge gap on the analysis of horizontal heterogeneity and the design of complementary compensation policies. In chapter \ref{sec:methods}, we introduce our modelling approach combining household budget survey and multi-regional input-output data. We present empirical methods to describe both, within-country heterogeneity and cross-country similarities. In chapter \ref{sec:results}, we analyze the relative importance of features (i.e. household characteristics) on the country-level and cluster countries, if features are similarly important. Lastly, we discuss our findings in light of on-going debates about how to circumvent or address unintended distributional impacts of climate policy in chapter \ref{sec:discussion} before we conclude in chapter \ref{sec:conclusion}.  

\section{Literature: Vertical and horizontal impacts of climate policy} \label{sec:literature}

% Introduce distributional impacts of climate policy - importance for public support
One important criterion for climate policy analysis is the distribution of policy impacts across households. While all households benefit from mitigated climate change, policy-induced costs may differ for different households. Such distributional impacts can impede policy implementation, for example because governments are opposing larger inequality per se or because of lower public support \autocite{Bergquist.2022,Douenne.2022}. 

% Show why distributional impacts can happen (theoretical arguments).
Accordingly, researchers have been engaging with the distributional effects of environmental policy reforms for a long time \autocite{Cremer.2003,Poterba.1991,Sandmo.1975,Stiglitz.2019}. In essence, households that consume more of a polluting good can expect higher absolute costs when pollution becomes more costly, but relative additional costs depend on expenditure shares for polluting goods, which differ with income \autocite{Jacobs.2019,Dorband.2019}. Moreover, the distribution of such additional costs depends on the distribution of less-polluting technology. If some households have access to less carbon-intensive technologies, then climate policy may increase inequality, posing a difficult trade-off between efficiency and equity \autocite{Hansel.2022}. 

% Show that vertical distributional impacts exist
Many researchers have quantified the \textit{vertical} distributional effects of different climate policy instruments, i.e., differences in policy outcomes between relatively poorer and relatively richer households. For price-based climate policy (such as carbon pricing), such work includes analyses in single countries \autocite{Goulder.2019,Grainger.2010,Rausch.2011,Garaffa.2021,Sterner.2012,Wu.2022} or across countries \autocite{Budolfson.2021,Feindt.2021,Dorband.2019,Steckel.2021b,VogtSchilb.2019,Missbach.2024}. Particularly in many high-income countries, price-based policies are often found to be regressive. In contrast, results from a meta-analysis \autocite{Ohlendorf.2021} document more progressive results in lower income countries and for price-based policies in the transport sector.

A different strand of the literature investigates vertical distributional impacts for other policy instruments, such as fossil fuel subsidy removal \autocite{Schaffitzel.2019,Giuliano.2020}, technology standards \autocite{Levinson.2019,Zhao.2022,Bruegge.2019}, subsidies on cleaner goods \autocite{Borenstein.2016,Vaishnav.2017,Winter.2019} or behavioural interventions \autocite{DellaValle.2020,Liebe.2021}. In substance, distributional effects depend on the heterogeneous preference for and endowment with less-polluting technologies. 

% Show that there is little sound understanding of horizontal impacts across many countries
More recently, researchers have started to become interested in the \textit{horizontal} distributional effects of climate policy, i.e., differences in policy outcomes among similarly poor or rich households \autocite{Rausch.2011,Fischer.2019}. One reason is that variation \textit{within} expenditure quintiles may differ more substantially than \textit{between} quintiles \autocite{Cronin.2019,Steckel.2021b,Pizer.2019}. Horizontal differences indicate that households use technologies with heterogeneous carbon-intensity, which can however not be attributed to heterogeneous levels of household affluence \autocite{Hansel.2022}. In comparison to vertical distributional impacts, empirically investigating the horizontal distributional impacts of climate policy received little attention: Research highlights the role of sociodemographic variables (such as household size, education and occupation) \autocite{Grainger.2010,Buchs.2013,Farrell.2017,Missbach.2023}, energy use \autocite{Steckel.2021b,Missbach.2024} and space \autocite{Chan.2023,Burtraw.2009} for differences in additional costs.

% Explain why horizontal implications matter --> Redistribution
One frequently proposed option to address unintended distributional effects of climate policy is compensating households for increasing costs \autocite{Klenert.2018,Baranzini.2017}. Often, researchers suggest lump-sum transfers for households that would indeed render the vertical distribution more progressive \autocite{Budolfson.2021,Steckel.2021b,vanderPloeg.2022}, but neglect or even increase horizontal differences \autocite{Cronin.2019,Hansel.2022}. Essentially, combining price-based climate policies with revenue-neutral lump-sum transfers would fail to compensate those households that would bear the largest additional costs and such additional costs would remain larger for larger levels of horizontal heterogeneity. Assuming climate policy should also serve the purpose of least distributive distortions \autocite{Fischer.2019} or of increasing public support by shielding especially vulnerable households, then appropriate design of compensation measures requires accounting for horizontal inequality of policies, rendering popular instruments, such as lump-sum transfers, less effective \autocite{Missbach.2024}. 

Instead, many complementing compensation measures are theoretically conceivable: Lowering taxes on labor can be preferable on efficiency grounds \autocite{Goulder.1995,Bento.2018}, green spending can lead to increasing public support \autocite{Sommer.2022}, funding public infrastructure can help promoting development goals \autocite{Franks.2018,Jakob.2016} and subsidizing or providing subsistence goods (including energy) may prevent detrimental impacts on the poorest households \autocite{Greve.2022,Schaffitzel.2019}. Horizontal inequality may also warrant targeted transfers to households with large additional costs, albeit with detrimental consequences for aggregate efficiency \autocite{Hansel.2022}. In any case, effectively accounting for the distributional effects of climate policy and designing complementing compensation policies requires precise information about the horizontal heterogeneity and household-level characteristics beyond income or total expenditures that help explain it. 

% Show that cross-country studies exist, but do not include the micro-level information
Our study also connects to research comparing within-country heterogeneity of carbon-intensive consumption across countries and time. For example, \textcite{Chancel.2022} creates a time-series of country- and percentile-level carbon footprints, notably including households' investments decisions, and finds that \textit{carbon inequality} within countries has increased over the last thirty years. Others \autocite{Oswald.2020,Bruckner.2022} compare the distribution of carbon footprints across and within countries, but such macro-level studies remain calm about policy impacts and their associated vertical and horizontal distributional implications.

% Demonstrate gap and highlight contribution
Building on these findings from existing literature, our paper provides a comprehensive analysis of vertical and horizontal distributional impacts of climate policy for a broad set of countries. Explicitly accounting for household characteristics beyond income or total expenditures, our paper analyzes factors driving heterogeneous costs of policies. Our flexible modelling framework allows for the simulation of different policies - including, but not limited to price-based policies such as carbon pricing - and can help to inform about potential complementing compensation measures that are likely effective in addressing heterogeneous policy impacts on households. Our study also contributes by highlighting the limitations of more traditional approaches to assess climate policies exclusively with respect to its \textit{vertical} distributional implications.

\section{Methods: Analyzing heterogeneity in carbon intensity of consumption} \label{sec:methods}

% Introduce carbon intensity of consumption as major indicator
We infer about the heterogeneous impacts of climate policy on consumption costs by analyzing heterogeneity in the carbon intensity of consumption: Assume household \textit{A's} consumption is twice as carbon-intensive as the consumption of household \textit{B}, then climate policy will lead to costs twice as high for household \textit{A} compared to household \textit{B}, in comparison to total expenditures\footnote{This holds under the assumption that climate policy increases supply-side input prices according to associated CO$_{2}$-emissions and that firms cannot react to changing input prices in the short-term. Output prices for consumer goods and services would increase in equivalence to embedded (direct and indirect) CO$_{2}$-emissions. Specifically, the carbon intensity reflects additional costs of any policy increasing consumer prices proportional to embedded CO$_{2}$-emissions, irrespective of existing policies. See also Appendix \ref{sec:policysimulation}.}.

The carbon intensity of consumption of household \textit{i}, denoted by $e_{i}$, is the variable of interest in this study. It reflects the amount of CO$_{2}$-emissions $E_{i}$ that one can reasonably attribute to production, transportation and retail of all goods and services purchased in household \textit{i}, over total consumption C$_{i}$. We express $e_{i}$ in $\frac{kgCO_{2}}{US-\$}$. More specifically, the carbon intensity of consumption represents carbon intensities of different sectors $e_{s}$, weighted by expenditure shares in household \textit{i} for goods and services from each sector \textit{s}, denoted as $w_{i,s}$:

% Argue backwards: Carbon intensity of consumption consists of household expenditure shares and sectoral carbon intensities

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ei}
e_{i} = \frac{E_{i}}{C_{i}} = \frac{\sum_{s} e_{s}*C_{i,s}}{\sum_{s} C_{i,s}} = \sum_{s} e_{s}*w_{i,s}
\end{equation}

% Show that carbon intensity is equivalent to first-order carbon pricing incidence (Detailed analysis in Appendix)
% Show that sector-specific carbon intensities can help to learn about other policies (to be continued in discussion)

Examining the household-level carbon intensity for different sectors \textit{s}, denoted $e_{i,s}$, allows for understanding heterogeneous impacts of different policies, for example of policies in the transport or electricity sector or of trade policies, such as carbon border adjustments.

%  Household expenditure shares: Data, cleaning, homogenizing and shortcomings
\paragraph{Sectoral expenditure shares} We collect information on sectoral expenditure shares at the household-level ($w_{i,s}=\frac{C_{i,s}}{\sum_{s}C_{i,s}}$) from household budget surveys (see Table \ref{tab:datasets}). In such surveys, households report expenditures on goods and services on the item-level, from which we compute sectoral expenditure shares\footnote{We match consumption items to sectors with the help of matching tables. We share all matching tables through a stable online data repository.}\footnote{Figure \ref{fig:Engel} shows country-level Engel curves for energy, goods, services and food.}.
Survey datasets are eligible for inclusion in our study, if they cover a nationally representative sample, include item-level expenditure information and were conducted between 2010 and 2019\footnote{We exclude more recent survey data to account for potential biases induced by large economic shocks, such as measures in the context of Covid-19.}. Our harmonized\footnote{Appendix \ref{sec:cleaning} lists details on cleaning and harmonization.} dataset contains information on more than 1.5 million households representative for 5 billion people from 87 countries that comprise 68\% of global GDP and 52\% of global CO$_{2}$-emissions\footnote{We calculate these numbers with data for GDP and CO$_{2}$-emissions from the World Development Indicators database \autocite{WorldBankGroup.2023}.}.

Beyond expenditure shares, we include total household expenditures as a surrogate for household income data because total consumption expenditures are a meaningful proxy for lifetime income \autocite{Poterba.1989,Poterba.1991,Cronin.2019} and because wage data from such surveys are often unreliable \autocite{Blundell.1998}. Acknowledging differences between using expenditures or income data in the context of calculating carbon footprints \autocite{Levay.2023} we proceed treating total household expenditures and income as synonyms in the remainder of the study.

We also include socio-demographic information about household members (such as education, occupation, gender, self-identified ethnicity or age of household representatives), detailed spatial information (such as province, district or village of households) and on energy use (main fuels used for cooking, lighting and heating) or appliance and vehicle ownership. Such household-level information (including total household expenditures) forms a set of variables $X_{i}^{'}$ that allows for analyzing differences between households with different characteristics\footnote{Table \ref{tab:A1} shows summary statistics for all countries in our sample; Table \ref{tab:A2} shows average household expenditures and average energy expenditure shares for each expenditure quintile and each country. We also show the share of households using different cooking fuels (Table \ref{tab:A4_CF}), lighting fuels (Table \ref{tab:A5_LF}) and the possession of different major appliances (Table \ref{tab:A6}) for all countries where data are available.}.

% \end{itemize}

% Sectoral carbon intensities: Data, method, intuition and shortcomings
\paragraph{Sectoral carbon intensities} Country- and sector-level carbon intensities $e_{s,r}$ represent CO$_{2}$-emissions that can directly or indirectly be attributed to one unit of (household) consumption from sector \textit{s} in region \textit{r}.

\begin{equation}
    e_{s,r} = \frac{E_{s,r}^{direct}+E_{s,r}^{indirect}}{\sum_{i} C_{i,s,r}}
\end{equation}

We derive total sectoral consumption ($\sum_{i} C_{i,s,r}$), direct ($E_{s}^{direct}$) and indirect ($E_{s}^{indirect}$) CO$_{2}$-emissions from and with the help of multi-regional input-output (MRIO) data. This approach is popular in the literature as it accommodates trade flows between different countries and regions, but features sufficient detail for high sectoral resolution. 

We build on trade data from the GTAP database (Version 11,  \textcite{Aguiar.2022}) that we transform to MRIO data \autocite{Peters.2011}, capturing input-output relationships between 65 sectors \textit{s} in 160 countries \textit{r}. We subsequently compute the \textit{Leontief}-inverse $L_{r',s'}^{r,s}$ that captures information about required inputs from each sector \textit{s'} and region \textit{r'} for production of one unit of output in each sector \textit{s} and region \textit{r}. We derive indirect CO$_{2}$-emissions $E_{s}^{indirect}$ as follows\footnote{See \textcite{Missbach.2024, Steckel.2021b,Feindt.2021,VogtSchilb.2019} for a detailed description of this approach.} \footnote{Simulation of different sectoral and regional policies is possible through exclusion of different sectors \textit{s} or countries \textit{r}. Our flexible framework also allows for analyzing the impacts of policies targeted at non-CO$_{2}$-emissions, such as CH$_{4}$, N$_{2}$O or F-gases. In our main analysis we focus on national carbon intensities, i.e., how many CO$_{2}$-emissions resulting from production within each country can be attributed to one unit of output. This would be equivalent to zero carbon intensities of imported products, but re-imported emissions would be included. See also Appendix \ref{sec:policysimulation}.}:

\begin{equation}
    E_{s}^{indirect} = \sum_{r'} \sum_{s'} e_{r',s'} L_{r',s'}^{r,s} C_{s}
\end{equation}

The GTAP database also includes information on direct CO$_{2}$-emissions $E_{s}^{direct}$. It captures CO$_{2}$-emissions resulting from household-level use of fossil fuels, such as gasoline, natural gas, LPG or hard coal.

Our resulting dataset contains information on the carbon intensity of (household) consumption $e_{s,r}$ for 65 sectors \textit{s} and 160 countries \textit{r}, reflecting technologies, prices and trade flows between sectors and countries for the year 2017\footnote{We show country- and sector-level carbon intensities in Figure \ref{fig:B}.}. We link this dataset with household-level expenditure shares as described in \ref{eq:ei} to compute household-specific carbon intensity of consumption $e_{i}$.

% Summary statistics 

The average CO$_{2}$-intensity of household consumption across countries is 0.68 kgCO$_{2}$/USD. As we show in Table \ref{tab:A3}, the average CO$_{2}$-intensity is highest for South Africa (2.15 kgCO$_{2}$/USD) followed by Turkey (1.75 kgCO$_{2}$/USD) and Czech Republic (1.71 kgCO$_{2}$/USD). The average CO$_{2}$-intensity is lowest for Malawi (0.03 kgCO$_{2}$/USD), Rwanda (0.04 kgCO$_{2}$/USD), Ethiopia and Niger (both 0.1 kgCO$_{2}$/USD). Country-level CO$_{2}$-intensities help to infer about the relative average costs of climate policy in countries: For example, a carbon price of 40 USD/tCO$_{2}$ \autocite{Stiglitz.2017b} would be equivalent to relative average costs of 2.7\% of total expenditures in a country with an average CO$_{2}$-intensity of 0.68 kgCO$_{2}$/USD.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Methodological discussion and shortcomings (brief)
%     \item Older GTAP-data available. More recent GTAP-data unavailable.
%     \item What is good: Homogenized approach for consistent analysis across countries.
% \end{itemize}

\paragraph{Vertical and horizontal differences in carbon intensity of consumption}

Analyses of distributional impacts of climate policy often focus on comparing average (or median) costs of policies for different income groups of households. One frequent approach is to assign households to income (or expenditure) quintiles to infer about vertical differences. Often, researchers also compute measures for within-group heterogeneity, such as the $25^{th}$ or $75^{th}$ quantile within each expenditure quintile \autocite{Cronin.2019, Missbach.2024}. Comparing such quantile costs across expenditure quintiles can help to infer about horizontal differences.

Figure \ref{fig:fig_1} displays the distribution of carbon intensity of consumption among the poorest quintile in all countries of our sample with the help of boxplots. Boxes and whiskers contain 90\% of all households in each quintile. Coloured bars show the difference between the lowest and the highest median carbon intensity across all quintiles for each country.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{Figure 1/Figure_1_2017}
    \caption{Vertical differences and distribution of carbon intensity within poorest quintiles}
    \label{fig:fig_1}
    \begin{subcaption2}
    Boxplots display the distribution of household-level carbon intensity within the poorest quintile in each of 87 countries: The boxes display the $25^{th}$ and $75^{th}$ percentile; whiskers display the $5^{th}$ and $95^{th}$ percentile, respectively. Rhombuses display the mean. Blue and red bars represent the vertical difference in household-level carbon intensity, i.e., the difference between the highest and the lowest median carbon intensity across quintiles. Blue (red) bars indicate that the average carbon intensity is higher (lower) in richer households compared to poorer households. See also Figure \ref{fig:Quint}.
    \end{subcaption2}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:fig_1} illustrates that within-quintile heterogeneity exceeds between-quintile heterogeneity in \textit{all} countries\footnote{See Figure \ref{fig:Quint} for country-level comparisons across all expenditure quintiles and Table \ref{tab:A3} for summary statistics on carbon footprints and carbon intensity of consumption.}. This underlines that analyses building on differences in income to explain differences in carbon intensity of consumption (or the impact of climate policy) might be insufficient, since it falls short of accounting for differences in carbon intensity at similar levels of income. Instead, we propose including household-level characteristics beyond income in such analyses to give a more nuanced description of which households' consumption is especially carbon-intensive.

This is also warranted, because - as we show in Figure \ref{fig:fig_2} - within-quintile differences vary across quintiles. To facilitate comparison across countries, we compute two coefficients \autocite{Missbach.2024}: The vertical distribution coefficient $\overline{V_{r}}$ compares median carbon intensity of the poorest and the richest expenditure quintile:

\begin{equation}
    \widehat{V_{r}} = \frac{\overline{e_{EQ1}}}{\overline{e_{EQ5}}}
\end{equation}

If median carbon intensity among poorer households exceeds (is smaller than) the median carbon intensity of richer households, then $\widehat{V_{r}}>1$ ($\widehat{V_{r}}<1$) and climate policy would likely lead to regressive (progressive) outcomes.

The horizontal distribution coefficient $\overline{H_{r}}$ compares within-quintile differences of the poorest and the richest expenditure quintile:

\begin{equation}
    \widehat{H_{r}} = \frac{e_{EQ1}^{95} - e_{EQ1}^{5}}{e_{EQ5}^{95} - e_{EQ5}^{5}}
\end{equation}

$\widehat{H_{r}}>1$ ($\widehat{H_{r}}<1$) would indicate that within-quintile differences are larger (smaller) among poorer compared to richer households.

Figure \ref{fig:fig_2} illustrates that the average carbon intensity of consumption is larger among the poorest quintile in 43 out of 87 countries compared to the richest quintile. These countries have a higher GDP per capita than others: We observe $\widehat{V_{r}}>1$ for 20 out of 20 countries in our sample with the highest GDP per capita. In these countries, climate policy is likely to have regressive effects. Similarly, carbon intensity is higher for richer quintiles compared to poorer quintiles ($\widehat{V_{r}}<1$ ) in 18 out of 20 countries in our sample with the lowest GDP per capita. In these countries, climate policy is likely to have progressive effects. Both findings are in line with inverse-U-shaped Engel curves for carbon-intensive goods and services across countries and income quintiles \autocite{Dorband.2019}. 

%Interestingly, this does not necessarily hold in each single country. Indeed, interesting.

% Check all numbers
In 58 out of 87 countries, within-quintile variation (expressed as the difference between the $5^{th}$ and the $95^{th}$ percentile within quintiles) is larger in the poorest quintile compared to the richest quintile. Horizontal differences, i.e. within-quintile heterogeneity, exceed vertical differences, i.e. between-quintile heterogeneity in 66 countries, emphasizing the need for detailed investigation of household characteristics associated to higher levels of carbon intensity of consumption.

In response, one core assumption of this study is that $e_{i}$, the carbon intensity of household \textit{i}, correlates with observable household characteristics $X_{i}^{'}$:

\begin{equation}
    e_{i} \sim X_{i}^{'}
\end{equation}

% Which criteria should be included in modelling and why?
% Discuss main arguments for single characteristics (possibly already in methods section).

To shed light on which household characteristics correlate with and lead to higher levels of carbon intensity of consumption we build on two modeling approaches, namely boosted regression trees (BRT) and a logit-model.

\paragraph{Boosted regression trees} Fitting boosted regression trees (BRT) \autocite{Friedman.2003, Elith.2008} is a supervised machine learning method allowing for detection of non-linear relationships and interaction effects between an outcome and many predictor variables (\textit{features}). As an extension to regression trees, the BRT algorithm (\textit{XGBoost} \autocite{Chen.2016}) fits many single regression trees, iteratively giving higher weights to observations with larger predicting errors. This leads to large predictive power, also if compared to the frequently used random forest algorithm. Nevertheless, fitting BRT is more computationally intensive and outcomes are more difficult to interpret compared to outcomes from other machine learning models. % Why BRT is helpful here.

Drawing on BRT serves the purpose of our analysis, because it is a priori ambiguous which variables warrant inclusion in a model. In addition, research indicates that the impacts of climate policy (and therefore the carbon intensity of consumption) distribute non-linearly across households with different characteristics, such as income, demographic groups \autocite{Missbach.2023}, energy use \autocite{Farrell.2017} and space \autocite{Chan.2023}. In contrast to other approaches, such as variance-based inequality decomposition \autocite{Farrell.2017,Sager.2019b,Missbach.2024}, using BRT is well-suited to help identifying important predictors while also allowing for detection of non-linear relationships.

We fit BRT-models on the country-level to investigate characteristics associated to heterogeneous levels of carbon intensities within single countries. The carbon intensity $e_{i}$ is the outcome variable. For each country-level model we use the entire set of observable household-level characteristics $X_{i}^{'}$ as possible features and perform several feature engineering steps (see also Appendix \ref{sec:featureengineering}). In addition, we include only total household expenditures as single feature for prediction to distil the contribution of richer models including many features that are often not included in such analyses.

The predictive performance of BRT-models critically hinges on several hyperparameters. For hyperparameter tuning, we randomly split country-level data into a training and a test sample, comprising 80\% and 20\% of observations, respectively. We use five-fold cross-validation on the training sample to fit 1,000 trees - following the recommendations by \textcite{Elith.2008} - along with 30 different combinations of learning rate ($\eta \in [0.001,0.3]$), the maximum depth of trees (\textit{max\_depth} $\in \{x \in \mathbb{N} \mid 1  \leq x \leq 15 \}$) and a fraction of features included in each tree (\textit{mtry} $\in \{0.5,0.7,1\}$). We select combinations of hyperparameters such that combinations distribute evenly across the possible combination space. For each country, we select the combination of hyperparameters that minimizes mean absolute error (MAE).

Building on selected hyperparameters, we use five-fold cross-validation on all observations, i.e., from the training and test sample, for model evaluation. We evaluate model performance with the help of MAE, root mean squared error (RMSE) and goodness of fit ($R^{2}$). We also use all observations to evaluate the relative importance of each feature with the help of SHAP-values: Expressed in the unit of the outcome variable, SHAP-values represent the contribution of each feature to each individual prediction and have been proposed as a more suitable means to interpret outcomes of machine learning models compared to other approaches \autocite{Lundberg.2020}. We also determine feature importance by calculating the average absolute SHAP-value for each feature across all individual predictions. We show feature importance as a share of contribution (in \% of total mean absolute SHAP-values) to allow for better comparability of feature importance across countries. We visualize the distribution of SHAP-values for the most important features in each country over feature values, i.e. in partial dependence plots. 

\paragraph{Logit-model} For supplementary robustness analyses, we also fit a logit-model to identify households whose consumption is relatively more carbon-intensive compared to the entire population. We construct a binary variable $e_{i}^{80^{th}}$ for each household \textit{i} indicating whether the household is among the most carbon-intensive 20\% of households in each country:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:logit}
    e_{i}^{80^{th}} =
    \begin{cases}
    1, & \text{for }  e_{i} \geq e^{80^{th}} \\
    0, & \text{for }  e_{i} < e^{80^{th}}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Subsequently, be $P_{e_{i}^{80^{th}}}$ the probability of household \textit{i} to consume more carbon-intensively than 80\% of the population in each country. We are interested in the coefficients $\beta^{'}$ of the following logit-model:

\begin{equation} \label{logit}
    log \left( \frac{P_{e_{i}^{80}}}{1 - P_{e_{i}^{80}}} \right) = \alpha_{0} + \beta^{'} X_{i}^{'} + \varepsilon_{i}
\end{equation}

Estimating a logit-model serves as a robustness check for results from BRT-models. It also allows for investigation of characteristics associated to "hardship-case" households including a more accessible interpretation of results and parameters. We show results from logit-models with the help of regression tables and visualize average marginal effects for each independent variable.

\paragraph{Identifying country clusters} Country-level analyses can be meaningful to identify country-specific household characteristics associated to higher levels of carbon intensity of consumption. To investigate similarities and differences between countries, we seek to identify clusters of countries to learn more about which features are more important in many countries. In fact, the relationship between household-level characteristics and carbon intensity of consumption is unique for each country, but also contingent on the availability of granular data. To account for differences in available features across countries, we adjust individual feature importance by multiplying individual feature importance and country-level R$^{2}$. This approach also helps to account for the aggregate performance of country-level models and allows for better comparison of feature importance across countries.

Building on (adjusted) feature importance for each country, we use k-means algorithm for clustering. If features are missing in the data, we assume their share of contribution is zero. We normalize all feature values to allow for comparison across features. If one feature is more (less) important in one country compared to all other countries, the processed feature value will be relatively high (low). If one feature is equally important across all countries, processed feature values will be close to zero.

K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine-learning method and helps to analyze clusters of observations that are most similar in many variables within each cluster and least similar in many variables across clusters \autocite{MacQueen.1967}. We inspect the optimal number of clusters ($\{k \in \mathbb{N} \mid 2  \leq k \leq 20 \}$) with the help of average silhouette widths \autocite{Rousseeuw.1987} for each cluster \textit{k}. The silhouette width $s_{i}$ accounts for the average Euclidean distance of each observation \textit{i} to all other observations within its cluster and for the average distance to observations from the nearest neighbouring cluster. Silhouettes closer to $1$ indicate a good fit of an observation to its cluster and silhouettes closer to $-1$ indicate a poor fit. The average silhouette width $\overline{s_{k}}$ for each cluster \textit{k} expresses how well all observations fit on average to each cluster. Our approach yields $k = 6$ to be the number of clusters maximizing average silhouette width\footnote{See Figures\subref{fig:G3_silhouette_2} and \subref{fig:G4_silhouette_2} for visualization.}. We also show the optimal number of clusters ($k = 13$) for k-means clustering building on non-adjusted feature importance in the Appendix\footnote{See Figures \subref{fig:G1_silhouette} and \subref{fig:G2_silhouette} for visualization. Using non-adjusted feature importance for clustering changes the interpretation of clusters: Features of countries within the same cluster contribute similarly to explaining variation in carbon intensity without respecting the availability of features in the data and the explanatory power of the model.}.

In countries within the same cluster single features are similarly important to predict the carbon intensity of households. For each cluster, we compute average values for each feature to allow for investigation of differences between countries in different clusters.%We also investigate which country is most likely to all other countries in each cluster maximizing silhouette width within each cluster and use it to demonstrate cluster-level characteristics. 

It is important to note that our approach to adjust feature values for total model performance reduces bias through limited feature availability in the data. Uncorrected feature importance values may be exaggerated, if only few features exist, so countries with few features may end up in wrong clusters mainly because the model cannot help explaining much of the variation in carbon intensity. Instead, our approach ensures that all \textit{observable} features contribute to clustering. Despite many structurally unobservable household-level features, our approach might be warranted under the assumption that policy formulation (for example on optimal targeting of compensation measures) can naturally only center on observable characteristics, if targeting errors should be minimized.

\paragraph{Methodological limitations - \color{red}{maybe Appendix}}

Some aspects of our methodological approach pose a limitation and thus warrant attention.

For example, expenditure surveys are susceptible to many often-described inaccuracies: Expenditure survey data are prone to under-reporting, spare the upper end of the income distribution \autocite{Blanchet.2022} and reflect consumer prices and policy regimes in respective survey years. Our approach also neglects within-sector differences in carbon intensity of consumption and builds on consumer-price-dependent \textit{expenditures} to calculate household-level carbon intensity instead of quality and quantity of consumption. This implies that we systematically overlook consumption of goods and services traded on informal markets, which may be defensible, given that additional costs through climate policy are most likely to occur through formal consumption.

Our approach allows for a consistent, harmonized analysis across countries, but falls short of accounting for the deployment of cleaner technologies since 2017. Yet, more recent MRIO-data with broad geographical coverage are - to the best of our knowledge - unavailable. Also, our analysis can inform about the immediate impacts of climate policy, but neglects medium-term general equilibrium effects. 

One qualification is that our modelling approach is not apt to allow for causal interpretation, notably because we examine cross-sectional variation. Instead, we attempt to provide an accurate description of household characteristics correlating with households' carbon intensity, including non-linear relationships.

Collecting household-level data from various datasets impedes the cross-country comparison of model outcomes, because some features are lacking in some countries. In response, we adjust feature importance for models' predictive power, but it cannot be concluded from our results that carbon intensity is unpredictable \textit{per se}, if predictive power is low. Some important features may be unobserved by us, but not by governments or other actors interested in our results. For some countries, more nuanced data can help to flesh out more pervasive analyses.

\section{Results: Heterogeneity in carbon intensity of consumption} \label{sec:results}

Climate policy can lead to short-term costs, which distribute unevenly across the population according to heterogeneous household-level carbon intensity of consumption. The carbon intensity of households correlates with household characteristics, including - but not limited to - total household expenditures. In the following, we present an analysis of a set of household characteristics and their importance for predicting the carbon intensity of households. We compare results across countries and assign countries to clusters. Lastly, we assess the heterogeneity of carbon intensities with different regional and sectoral coverage.

\paragraph{Model accuracy} 
% Main message: Predictive power is usually sufficient or acceptable.
As we show in Table \ref{tab:A8}, fitting BRT-models helps to predict households' carbon intensity with good precision in many countries. Models' goodness of fit (R$^{2}$) accumulates to 59\% for Jordan, 53\% for Peru or 50\% for Nicaragua and Niger. For 28 countries, R$^{2}$ exceeds 30\%. For some countries, however, our models yield relatively low predictive performance: In 18 countries, R$^{2}$ does not exceed 10\%. Model performance is lowest in Bulgaria (1\%), Estonia (2\%), Serbia (3\%) and Suriname (3\%). One reason is that model accuracy hinges critically on data granularity. For many countries with low predictive performance our models are restricted to drawing on few available features, such as household expenditures, sub-national area identifiers, household size or education of household head.

% Low predictive power is an interesting finding.
Low model accuracy in some countries implies that it is difficult to infer about the carbon intensity of households through observable characteristics, such as household expenditures. In Bulgaria, for example, vertical differences are small and horizontal differences within expenditure quintiles are large (Figure \ref{fig:Quint_B}). Moreover, as our analysis confirms, within-quintile variation in total expenditures is largely uncorrelated with variation in carbon intensity. In such contexts, compensation measures based on expenditures of households (such as reducing consumption taxes) would likely benefit all households equally in absolute terms, but prove ineffective to compensate households with highest costs. 

% Comparison shows that including only total household expenditures is insufficient.
In general, variation in total household expenditures is often not sufficient to predict household-level carbon intensity. Figure \ref{fig:comparison} (see also Table \ref{tab:A8}) compares the goodness of fit (R$^{2}$) for \textit{sparse} BRT-models including only household expenditures as feature and for \textit{rich} BRT-models including many features. On average, R$^{2}$ accumulates to 5\% for sparse models compared to 23\% for rich models. In 79 countries, variation in household expenditures does not contribute to explaining more than 10\% of variation in carbon intensity. In contrast, model performance increases substantially when including additional features, for example in the case of Jordan from 3\% to 59\% (R$^{2}$). Such comparison provides additional evidence for the importance to analyze heterogeneity in policy impacts beyond (vertical) differences in affluence.  

\paragraph{Country-level feature importance}
% Features are not equally important across countries
The importance of features for predicting variation in carbon intensity differs across countries. Figure \ref{fig:fig_4} and Table \ref{tab:A10} show adjusted feature importance for all features in each country and our indicators for vertical and horizontal inequality and the mean CO$_{2}$-intensity, grouped by country clusters\footnote{See Table \ref{tab:A10_Uncorrected} for non-adjusted feature importance for all features in each country.}. 

Figure \ref{fig:5b} shows partial dependence plots for each country, visualizing the distribution of SHAP-values, i.e. the contribution to predicted carbon intensity of consumption for different feature values. While feature importance helps to identify features explaining heterogeneity in carbon intensity, the distribution of SHAP-values indicates the (non-linear) relationships between features and the outcome variable.

% Household expenditures.
On average and without adjustment, the most important feature across countries is household expenditures, accounting for a relative contribution of 22\% on average. Household expenditures are the single most important feature for prediction in 30 countries, and in some countries, such as \hyperref[fig:5b_LUX]{Luxembourg} or \hyperref[fig:5b_HRV]{Croatia}, differences in household expenditures contribute to more than 50\% of model prediction. Household expenditures account for largest shares of adjusted feature importance in \hyperref[fig:5b_PER]{Peru} (18\%), \hyperref[fig:5b_ECU]{Ecuador} (14\%) and \hyperref[fig:5b_IRQ]{Iraq} (14\%) - countries in which we also identify consistently larger carbon intensities for poorer households compared to richer households. The relationship between expenditures and carbon intensity is non-linear, but overall declining for 53 countries (e.g. \hyperref[fig:5b_EST]{Indonesia}), overall increasing for 14 countries (e.g. \hyperref[fig:5b_GHA]{Ghana}), following an inverse-U-shape for 11 countries (e.g. \hyperref[fig:5b_TUR]{Turkey}) and a U-shape for 5 countries (e.g. \hyperref[fig:5b_IND]{India}). We find declining relationships between household expenditures and carbon intensity for 19 of 20 countries with highest GDP per capita, which lends credibility to our analysis in section \ref{sec:methods}. In such countries, more carbon-intensively consuming households spend absolutely less on consumption, but relatively more on carbon-intensive goods and services.

% Motorcycle and car ownership
Motorcycle and car ownership is the most important feature in 15 and 14 countries, respectively. In \hyperref[fig:5b_BFA]{Burkina Faso}, \hyperref[fig:5b_MLI]{Mali}, \hyperref[fig:5b_NER]{Niger} or \hyperref[fig:5b_TGO]{Togo} variation in motorcycle ownership can be attributed to more than 20\% of variation in carbon intensity. Car ownership accounts for largest adjusted feature importance in \hyperref[fig:5b_JOR]{Jordan} (33\%) and \hyperref[fig:5b_TWN]{Taiwan} (25\%). On average, vehicle ownership is the most important \textit{adjusted} feature across all countries and features and can be a meaningful predictor for predicting climate policy impacts in some countries: Households owning motorcycles or cars are more likely to consume more carbon-intensively than households without such vehicles in every country of our sample. This links to the propensity of vehicle-owning (and -using) households to consume relatively more transport fuels than others.

% Space: urban/rural, district, province
Spatial features, such as urban or rural location, state, province or district of household, are the most important feature in 17 countries. For example, differentiating between urban and rural households contributes to more than 40\% of model prediction in countries such as \hyperref[fig:5b_CZE]{Czech Republic}, \hyperref[fig:5b_SVK]{Slovakia} or \hyperref[fig:5b_LVA]{Latvia}. We find urban households to consume less carbon-intensively compared to rural households in a majority of countries such as \hyperref[fig:5b_FRA]{France}, \hyperref[fig:5b_NOR]{Norway}, \hyperref[fig:5b_ESP]{Spain}, and more carbon-intensively in countries such as \hyperref[fig:5b_MNG]{Mongolia}, \hyperref[fig:5b_PAK]{Pakistan} or \hyperref[fig:5b_ROU]{Romania}. For \hyperref[fig:5b_IND]{India}, where state residence accounts for adjusted feature importance of 8\%, we document that households in Jharkand, West Bengal or Manipur consume more carbon-intensively compared to households from other states. In \hyperref[fig:5b_BOL]{Bolivia}, where department residence accounts for adjusted feature importance of 6\%, households in Pando or Cochabamba consume more carbon-intensively than households from other departments. Differences in carbon intensity across space hint towards the important role of access to energy and transport infrastructure. In many cities, for example, households may choose from different transport modes including public transportation, which might help to explain lower carbon intensities in urban households in relatively richer countries. 

% Energy use
Features describing energy use, such as main fuels used for cooking, lighting and heating, or electricity access and appliance ownership are the most important feature in eight countries. Main cooking fuel is an important feature in \hyperref[fig:5b_PER]{Peru} and \hyperref[fig:5b_NIC]{Nicaragua} with adjusted feature importance of 18\% and 14\%, respectively. In both countries, households cooking with LPG consume substantially more carbon-intensively than households cooking predominantly with firewood, a pattern that is consistent in all countries of our sample with a non-negligible share of households using firewood or charcoal. This result is consistent with our assumption of zero direct emissions for biomass, firewood or charcoal, because of informal markets and structural impediments to regulate (and tax) emissions from such sources. Using kerosene for lighting is associated to higher carbon intensity compared to electricity and other lighting sources in \hyperref[fig:5b_UGA]{Uganda}, \hyperref[fig:5b_RWA]{Rwanda} or \hyperref[fig:5b_ETH]{Ethiopia}. Information on heating fuels exists only in few countries, but is the single most important feature in \hyperref[fig:5b_TUR]{Turkey} and \hyperref[fig:5b_ARM]{Armenia}. Here, carbon intensity is higher in households heating with coal (\hyperref[fig:5b_TUR]{Turkey}) or natural gas (\hyperref[fig:5b_ARM]{Armenia}) compared to households heating with electricity.

% Electricity access and appliance ownership
Overall, electricity access is less often an important feature, contributing a maximum of 4\% of adjusted feature importance in \hyperref[fig:5b_SEN]{Senegal}. In a majority of countries, feature importance for electricity access is low, possibly because of overall high (e.g. \hyperref[fig:5b_VNM]{Vietnam} or \hyperref[fig:5b_PHL]{Philippines}) or low electricity access rates (e.g. \hyperref[fig:5b_MWI]{Malawi} or \hyperref[fig:5b_LBR]{Liberia}, see Table \ref{tab:A1}) or because of a low CO$_{2}$-intensity in the electricity sector (e.g. \hyperref[fig:5b_ETH]{Ethiopia} or \hyperref[fig:5b_KEN]{Kenya}, see Table \ref{tab:Electricity}).

% Appliance ownership
Instead, ownership of major household appliances (such as refrigerators, washing machines or air conditioning) is the most important feature in \hyperref[fig:5b_CHE]{Switzerland} and the \hyperref[fig:5b_PHL]{Philippines}, contributing 17\% of adjusted feature performance in the Philippines. This is less surprising, because appliance ownership is a more compelling, yet incomplete proxy for electricity \textit{use} compared to electricity \textit{access}.

% Sociodemographic features
Sociodemographic features, such as education, gender, self-identified ethnicity or religion or religion of household head, are the most important feature in three countries. In \hyperref[fig:5b_PRT]{Portugal}, where education of household accounts for 29\% of model prediction, households with tertiary education exhibit a higher carbon intensity than households with primary or secondary education. Adjusted feature importance for gender of household head is highest in \hyperref[fig:5b_BEN]{Benin} or \hyperref[fig:5b_TGO]{Togo}, where households with female household heads are found to consume less carbon-intensively. In \hyperref[fig:5b_ISR]{Israel}, households identifying themselves as Muslim are found to consume more carbon-intensively compared to households identifying as Jewish. Households reporting to live a traditional, religious or orthodox lifestyle consume more carbon-intensively compared to secular households. For 71 out of 87 countries, sociodemographic features do not exceed 3\% of adjusted feature importance, indicating their relatively low relevance across countries for predicting differences in carbon intensity.

\paragraph{Identifying country clusters}

% What are important criteria to assign countries to different clusters?
% Discuss meaningful variables. Go on level of clusters to discuss direction and intuition of effects.
% Discuss country clusters in general and data issues, idiosyncracy. For each country cluster, one could recommend specific policy actions --> going to discussion section
% How well do countries fit into clusters?
Building on adjusted feature importance for predicting household-level carbon intensity, the average carbon intensity of households and the vertical and horizontal distribution of countries, we identify six clusters of countries. Countries within clusters are more similar to each compared to countries in other clusters. In general, not all countries fit well into their clusters, as demonstrated through an average silhouette width of 0.27 (see Figures \subref{fig:G3_silhouette_2} and \subref{fig:G4_silhouette_2}). In cluster C, for example, silhouette width is negative for seven countries, which points to idiosyncratic patterns. In such contexts, it may be more difficult to draw conclusions about the distributional impacts of climate policy from the experience of other countries. 

% Introducing Figure 3
Figure \ref{fig:fig_3} shows the relative importance of different features across country-clusters, while clusters are ordered by cluster size. 

% Cluster A
The largest cluster A comprises 46 countries (including \hyperref[fig:5b_USA]{USA}, \hyperref[fig:5b_CAN]{Canada}, \hyperref[fig:5b_BRA]{Brazil} or \hyperref[fig:5b_DEU]{Germany}). In countries of this cluster, our analysis yields more carbon-intensive consumption among relatively poorer households and a larger heterogeneity in carbon intensity among poorer households compared to richer households. In comparison to other clusters, most features contribute relatively little to explaining variation in carbon intensity. For example, average adjusted feature importance is 3\% for household expenditures, which is the most important feature across all 87 countries. In general, countries in cluster A have in common that it is difficult to predict carbon intensity of households with available data. One reason is that we adjust country-level feature importance for models' performance, which influences the identification of country clusters. For example, 18 out of 18 countries with relatively low model performance ($R^{2}<$10\%) appear in cluster A. In particular, data resolution may be insufficient and does not cover important variables (35 countries in this cluster lack information on major cooking fuels and 29 countries lack information on car ownership). These results also allude to highly peculiar characteristics of heterogeneous carbon intensity with important implications for policy design, because attempts to compensate based on characteristics that are observable in our dataset (such as household expenditures) will not be effective to compensate the households most affected by climate policy. Yet, policy impacts can be large, as indicated by more carbon-intensive consumption (0.74 kgCO$_{2}$/US-\$ on average) compared to countries in other clusters. 

% Cluster B
In contrast, cluster B includes 19 countries (such as \hyperref[fig:5b_BGD]{Bangladesh}, \hyperref[fig:5b_NGA]{Nigeria} or \hyperref[fig:5b_PAK]{Pakistan}) with comparably less carbon-intensive consumption (0.30 kgCO$_{2}$/US-\$ on average). In countries of this cluster, consumption is more carbon-intensive among richer households and we also find a larger heterogeneity among richer households compared to poorer households. Motorcycle ownership, main lighting fuel and sociodemographic characteristics are relatively more important compared to other clusters, while adjusted feature importance for household expenditures is 3.7\%, on average.

% Cluster C
Cluster C comprises 13 countries (such as \hyperref[fig:5b_IND]{India}, \hyperref[fig:5b_IDN]{Indonesia}, \hyperref[fig:5b_MEX]{Mexico} and \hyperref[fig:5b_ZAF]{South Africa}) with comparably high average carbon intensity (1.05 kgCO$_{2}$/US-\$ on average). Within countries, differences in carbon-intensity are comparably small between poorer and richer households, but richer households consume more carbon-intensively in all countries, but Vietnam. Countries have in common that spatial information, appliance and car ownership are comparably important features. Compared to other clusters, countries are less similar to each other, expressed through an average silhouette width of X. 

% Cluster D
Cluster D consists of four countries of Latin America (\hyperref[fig:5b_BOL]{Bolivia}, \hyperref[fig:5b_ECU]{ECU}, \hyperref[fig:5b_PER]{Peru}, \hyperref[fig:5b_SLV]{El Salvador}) and \hyperref[fig:5b_IRQ]{Iraq}. Countries from this clusters can be characterized by a larger heterogeneity in carbon intensity between poorer households compared to richer households. Household expenditures and main cooking fuel stand out as important features compared to other clusters. 

% Cluster E
Countries of cluster E (\hyperref[fig:5b_ARM]{Armenia} and \hyperref[fig:5b_TUR]{Turkey}) differ from all other countries because the variation in the main heating fuel is comparably relevant for predicting carbon intensity. In contrast, households' main lighting fuel and spatial information are relatively important features in the two countries of cluster F (\hyperref[fig:5b_RWA]{Rwanda} and \hyperref[fig:5b_UGA]{Uganda})

While being stylized by nature our clustering approach helps to emphasize country-specific characteristics correlating with (and contributing to) heterogeneous impacts of climate policy on households. Importantly, we provide evidence for differences in household expenditures being less decisive for households' carbon intensity than often suggested. Features describing households' energy use can be helpful predictors in some countries (for example in clusters B, C, D, E and F), but not necessarily in every country. For example, main energy fuels contribute relatively little to prediction in countries of cluster A such as \hyperref[fig:5b_URY]{Uruguay}, \hyperref[fig:5b_URY]{Argentina} or \hyperref[fig:5b_CRI]{Costa Rica}, for which models' predictive power is comparably high.

    \begin{subcaption2}
    This figure shows the average importance of features (in normalized absolute average SHAP-values) across all countries from each cluster A to F. Colors express the average importance of features in a cluster in comparison to other clusters. Blue (red) colors indicate that a feature is relatively less (more) important on average in a cluster compared to all other clusters. 'Sociodemographic' comprises normalized absolute average SHAP values for features such as education, gender, self-identified ethnicity, nationality, religion or language. 'Spatial' comprises normalized absolute SHAP-values for province, district and urban/rural-identifiers. For horizontal inequality, blue (red) colors indicate a lower (higher) heterogeneity within the first expenditure quintile compared to the fifth expenditure quintile. For vertical inequality, blue (red) colors indicate lower (higher) median carbon intensity among the first expenditure quintile compared to the fifth expenditure quintile. For average CO$_{2}$-intensity, blue (red) colors indicate a lower (higher) average carbon intensity across clusters. We assign countries to 6 clusters performing k-means clustering. We also show all values in Table \ref{tab:A9}.
    \end{subcaption2}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Robustness check: Direction of effects}
Results from BRT-models do not only help to understand the contribution of individual features to prediction, but also indicate the relationships between feature values and carbon intensity as visualized in partial dependence plots (Figure \ref{fig:5b}). Supplementary analyses building on a logit-model (see Figure \ref{fig:Logit_ME} and Equation \ref{eq:logit}) corroborate our findings and allow for more accessible comparison across countries.

Across countries, we document that owning (and using) a car (Figure \subref{fig:Logit_ME_car}) or motorcycle (Figure \subref{fig:Logit_ME_motorcycle}) is associated to a significant increase in the likelihood to consume more carbon-intensively than 80\% of the population\footnote{For car ownership, one exception is Ethiopia, where car ownership is associated to a \textit{decrease} of 14\% ($p=0.045$) in the probability to be in the most-carbon intensive quintile. Our BRT-model yields non-adjusted feature importance of 0.1\% for \hyperref[fig:5b_ETH]{Ethiopia}.}. In eight countries, our estimates show a significantly ($p \leq 5\%$) greater probability to be in the most carbon-intensive quintile for urban households, but a lower probability in 32 countries, compared to rural households (Figure \subref{fig:Logit_ME_urban}). In a majority of countries, increasing expenditures is associated to a lower probability of being a hardship-case with estimates being smaller than and statistically different from zero for 62 countries (Figure \subref{fig:Logit_ME_exp}). Estimates are positive and significant ($p \leq 5\%$) for eight countries. In comparison, our analysis of vertical heterogeneity (Figure \ref{fig:fig_2}) yields progressive results in 44 countries. Therefore, in some countries poorer households may be more prone to consuming more carbon-intensively than 80\% of the population, even though the distribution is overall regressive, which again supports our claim that a focus on vertical heterogeneity can be misleading.

Nevertheless, logit-models answer a slightly different question compared to BRT-models. In particular, models with binary dependent variables can be useful for the analysis of distributional impacts, because they help describing how parts of the population (e.g. the most carbon-intensive quintile) differs from other parts population. For example, for Mexico we find that differences in cooking fuel use account for 2\% in adjusted feature importance for predicting carbon intensity, but cooking with coal instead of electricity is associated, on average, to a 44\% increased probability to consume more carbon-intensively than 80\% of the Mexican population. Under such circumstances, addressing the use of (specific) cooking fuels could need to be warranted even though adjusted feature importance is comparably low.

%\begin{itemize}
  % \item Marginal effects of logit-models per country for easier visualization in Appendix.
  %\item Robustness checks from Logit in text. More carbon-intensive households are more likely to use fossil fuels for cooking, such as coal, gas, or LPG, less likely to use firewood, charcoal or biomass for cooking, compared to households cooking with electricity.
%\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Heterogeneous impacts of sectoral and regional policies}

Our flexible analytical framework also allows for investigating the heterogeneous impacts of different policies by including or excluding CO$_{2}$-emissions\footnote{In principal, it is conceivable to include non-CO$_{2}$-emissions (such as CH$_{4}$, N$_{2}$O or F-gases) or to analyze policies which aim at curbing only such emissions. We leave this for further research.} from different sectors or regions. For example, Figure \ref{fig:comparison_policies} compares vertical and horizontal distribution coefficients for a national climate policy instrument (as in Figure \ref{fig:fig_2}) to an international climate policy instrument, i.e. which increases consumer prices in equivalence to embedded \textit{global} CO$_{2}$-emissions. We also show such coefficients for policy instruments targeted at the transport and electricity sector, respectively. The comparison of vertical and horizontal impacts across policies emphasizes policy-specific differences within expenditure quintiles: In comparison to national climate policy, international climate policy would lead to more heterogeneous impacts in richer households in 23 countries, because richer households usually spend relatively more on imported goods and services. For transport sector policies, we document more carbon-intensive consumption among richer households compared to poorer households in 59 countries while horizontal differences exceed vertical differences in 77 countries. In contrast, our findings indicate that electricity sector policies would likely affect poorer households more heavily in 62 countries with larger horizontal heterogeneity among poorer households in 64 countries\footnote{Both findings are in contrast to national climate policy across all sectors: We find more carbon-intensive consumption among richer households in richer households compared to poorer households in 43 countries. Within-quintile heterogeneity is larger among poorer households in 58 countries and horizontal inequality exceeds vertical inequality in 66 countries.}. 
On aggregate, these results underpin that distributional implications of climate policy are country- and policy-specific, but that within-quintile heterogeneity is meaningful, hinting to limited leeway for effective cross-country policy learning\footnote{Of course, it is possible to analyze the importance of single household characteristics for predicting outcomes of different policies, but we refrain from this exercise for now.}.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Vertical and horizontal indicators: In how many countries?
% \item National 43 regressive, 44 progressive - 58 larger among poorer households - horizontal exceed vertical in 66 countries
% \item Global 45 regressive, 42 progressive - 54 larger among poorer households - horizontal exceed vertical in 58 countries. Story here is that inequality among richer households increases because richer households have a larger taste for imported goods and services.
% \item Transport 28 regressive, 59 progressive - 49 larger among poorer households - horizontal exceed vertical in 77 countries. Story here is very progressive results with large horizontal inequality!
%\item Electricity 62 regressive, 25 progressive - 64 larger among poorer households - horizontal exceed vertical in 62 countries. Story here is more regressive results with large horizontal inequality among poorer households.

\section{Discussion: Unpacking the policy toolbox} \label{sec:discussion}

\begin{itemize}
% State findings
\item Our findings provide evidence for country-specific characteristics associated to higher levels of carbon intensity of consumption. These results can help in ex-ante assessments to identify especially affected household profiles and promising means to compensate them. Building on identified clusters, we discuss implications for potential compensation.
% Assign different compensation measures to normative implications or theoretical grounds.
\item Some compensation measures are preferable to others, conditional on normative considerations.
\item In some setting, some compensation measures can be effective.
% LST
\item Often-proposed lump-sum transfers: Taste for reducing vertical inequality. "Rebound effect". High visibility. Low public acceptance. Popular among economists. Effective in cluster D or where expenditures are an important feature, more generally. Lump-sum transfers are useful in contexts where horizontal inequality is small.
% Targeted transfers
\item Targeted transfers: Can help reduce horizontal inequality. Helpful where expenditures are not an important feature. Discuss literature on targeting in general. Problem: Sets off the effects by the carbon tax.
% Tax breaks
\item Tax breaks (income from labour, consumption): Preferable on efficiency grounds. Leverage to adjust vertical inequality. Reaping double-dividend. Low visibility. Popular among economists. Effective where results are regressive or where expenditures are an important feature.
% Exemption of transition fuels, infrastructure access,
\item Where other factors matter: Enabling access to efficient technologies absolutely crucial. "Allowing" people to employ clean technologies and to react to prices.
\item Can also be sectorally differentiated carbon taxes, for example on sectors, which are consumed disproportionately large by the rich (Stiglitz.2019).
% \item Non-priced interventions might be warranted in general, in case they change preferences.
% Green spending, general budget
% Discuss low predictive power and conclusions.  
\item Very important: Low predictive power means that any transfer will be ineffective to some extent! Important concern.
% Discuss value chain of climate policy implementation. Literature on public acceptance. Which distribution matters to households and why? How could compensation increase public support? Public support of which groups matter for people with political power? Nevertheless, informative character.
\item Such analysis can only form the foundation for more comprehensive analysis. To what extent does the distribution of cost burden influence the public perception? Comparably little systematic research, but important assumption. Welfare function of policymakers or winning coalition not clear, either. 
\item This analysis: informative character. Information may be used by policymakers to draw conclusions about the distribution of climate policy and identify \textit{need}, if anything, for compensation. 
% Discuss role of findings for design of different policies
\item Notably, all instruments entail distributional impacts, one form or the other. Discuss role of findings for design of different policies (standards, subsidies, brief ?)
% Inaccuracies
\item Discuss dynamic effects and inaccuracies in modeling approach (tax pass-through, short- vs. medium-term, technological path dependencies/barriers on household-level)
% Distinction 
\item Distinguish results from analyses about climate policy on labour, wealth, impacts, adaptation, co-benefits, co-costs. Investments: Not covered, only consumption. May required additional compensation measures, such as subsidizing low-skilled labour in carbon-intensive sectors.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
% Motivation again: Why do we do what we do
It is defensible to argue that distributional implications play an important role for policy analysis. Data analysis can help to inform this process, in particular when heterogeneity of impacts is large or when governments have limited leverage to reimburse households for additional costs.

% Methodological contribution
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to provide a detailed analysis of heterogeneous impacts of climate policy on households across a wide range of countries. Specifically, our flexible framework integrating multi-regional input-output data with detailed household expenditure data allows for analyzing country- and policy-specific impacts.

% Core contribution: Horizontal inequality is neglected.
Our results show that differences in total household expenditures can be important for explaining differences in policy outcomes, but that a focus on these differences misses important parts of the picture. Instead, horizontal impacts outweigh vertical impacts and models building on household expenditures show low model precision. We show that it is necessary to factor in other, often-neglected household characteristics, such as information on energy use, vehicle and appliance ownership, space or sociodemography, to facilitate a detailed analysis of factors associated to heterogeneity in climate policy outcomes.

% Empirical analysis - what we show instead.
For each country, we quantify the contribution of single features and show that some features are more important in some countries than in others. Identifying country clusters demonstrates that distributional impacts of climate policy are often hardly comparable across countries, calling for detailed country-level investigations, which may possibly build on more granular country-level data.

% What future research might look like.
It is not only economists who conduct welfare analysis, but also those that engage with the political economy that have been interested in distributional impacts of welfare-enhancing policy proposals. While this study provides a comprehensive assessment about how costs distribute among the population, it is less clear how the \textit{distribution} of costs is perceived by the public. Often, it is argued that people prefer progressive outcomes out of justice considerations, but large horizontal heterogeneity, subjective beliefs \autocite{Douenne.2022} and scattered perceptions of fairness \autocite{MaestreAndres.2019,Povitkina.2021} cast doubt on this assumption. Future research could contribute to better understand how the distribution of policy costs shapes the public acceptability of climate policy. Similarly, some policy instruments and complementary compensation mechanisms may be more acceptable to the population than others, but research providing theory and empirical evidence remains sparse, at least in comparison to the literature quantifying distributional impacts. 

% Last paragraph rounding things up
Complementing climate policy with compensation measures to circumvent unintended policy outcomes can be a cornerstone of effective climate change mitigation. Our study contributes by explicating the heterogeneity in carbon intensity of consumption and identifying supplementary policies that may help governments to achieve any distribution of costs compared to the status quo that is desired, while at the same time implementing policies that improve welfare on aggregate. Heterogeneous outcomes of climate policy may matter as a matter of fact, but do not need to. After all, it would be worthwhile if academic and public discourses would start to center around the question \textit{which} distribution of costs would be normatively desirable, instead of asking for alternative policy solutions when typically preferred options are deemed unjust, unacceptable to the public and therefore infeasible. 

% \begin{itemize}
 %\item Differences in income one important criterion for comparing outcomes across groups.
 %\item Misses important parts of the picture. Necessary to factor in other characteristics.
 %\item More nuanced analyses can help to facilitate discussion on acceptable climate policy.
 %\item We quantify the contribution of often neglected horizontal drivers.
 %\item Introduction of novel dataset.
 %\item Nice last sentence.

\section{Data cleaning} \label{sec:cleaning}

We describe our approach to collecting, cleaning and homogenizing microdata and to feature engineering for machine learning modeling.

\subsection{Collecting household data}

We collect household budget survey data and extract several information before cleaning and homogenizing. Household budget survey data are often publicly available, but sometimes subject to a considerable fee. Table \ref{tab:datasets} provides publishing organizations, names of surveys and links to datasets used in this study.

\begin{itemize}
    \item For each household, we include sociodemographic information about household members where available. In all survey, households are represented through 'household heads', i.e., persons who often contribute the largest share of household income or are responsible for purchase decisions. We use information for the 'household head' as a proxy for the entire household and collect information on education, occupation, gender, self-identified ethnicity, nationality or religion of the 'household head'. We standardize information on education by using the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to facilitate comparison across countries.
    \item We include spatial information where available, for example identifier for sub-national areas (provinces), sub-sub-national areas (districts) or villages. Often, surveys include an indicator for whether households live in urban or rural areas. Definitions of \textit{urban} and \textit{rural} may not be consistent across countries, but within countries.
    \item We include information on energy use, such as on primary fuels used for cooking, lighting and heating. We homogenize information on fuels across countries to account for different names and levels of detail across countries. For example, cooking fuels include charcoal, coal, electricity, firewood, gas, kerosene, liquid fuel, LPG, other biomass or unknown fuels.
    \item We capture information on electricity access and create a binary variable indicating if households have access to electricity through electricity grids, but also through generators or solar panels. 
    \item We collect information about ownership of major transport vehicles (such as cars, motorcycles and trucks) and major household appliances (such as refrigerators, air conditioning, washing machines and television). For each country, we only include information about ownership, not about the precise number of owned vehicles and appliances to improve consistency across countries.
    \item We collect all available information on household-level expenditures, integrating information from household-level and individual-level diary entries. We do not include consumption information from home production, received as gifts or as remuneration for labor. Our rationale is that it would be difficult to cover self-produced goods and services that are not purchased on markets. We include all expenditures on the item-level and extrapolate expenditures to yearly values. Often, households track expenditures over the course of a few weeks, but provide details on less frequent purchases in the past months or year. This approach neglects seasonal consumption patterns, but resulting bias should be sufficiently small, since households are surveyed throughout the year.
    \item We do not include imputed expenditures, e.g., for hypothetical rental payments, since including them would give an inaccurate representation of household consumption.
\end{itemize}

Code written for each country-level dataset can be found in a stable online repository (see \ref{code}).

\subsection{Cleaning and homogenizing household data}

Building on raw microdata from household budget surveys we perform several cleaning steps in order to homogenize datasets across countries.

\begin{itemize}
    \item We remove households with missing information for variables such as household size, sampling weights or total expenditures.
    \item We address outliers of household expenditures at the item-level. We consider any observation an outlier if it is in the 99$^{th}$ percentile of all non-zero expenditures. We replace this observation with item-level median expenditures.
    \item We remove observations if expenditures are negative, for example, if households sell items.
    \item We remove duplicates from our sample. We check separately for duplicates at the level of household-level information and at the level of item expenditures: We consider households spending the same amount of money on the same items duplicates.
    \item We remove all households from our sample if aggregate expenditures exceed mean expenditures by five standard deviations ($z>5$).
    \item We use inflation rates from \textcite{IMF.2020} and exchange rates from the \textcite{WorldBankGroup.2023} to convert all local currencies to US-\$ for the year 2017. Expenditures from surveys conducted before 2017 are inflated; expenditures from surveys after 2017 are deflated. This ensures consistency with calculated CO$_{2}$-emissions as they refer to the year 2017. This approach does however neglect that expenditure shares may change with rising incomes and inflation.
    \item We create matching tables to assign country-level expenditure items to 65 aggregate sectors and to four broad expenditure categories (energy, food, goods, services). Items, that are difficult to match to a specific sector or to a specific category, e.g., 'other expenses', are matched to artificial sectors and categories labeled 'other'. We delete observations for items indicating aggregate categories, if this would lead to double-counting of single expenditures. We delete observations for items indicating taxes, since including them would prove inaccurate to calculate expenditure shares and because items indicating tax payments are not available in each country. We also identify items indicating energy use and create separate columns listing expenditures for different energy items, such as electricity, gasoline, diesel, kerosene, LPG, natural gas, charcoal, hard coal, firewood and other biomass. All matching tables are available through a separate stable online repository (see \ref{code}).
    \item We macth items pertaining to fuels such as firewood, charcoal and other biomass to the sector \textit{lumber} to account for indirect emissions attributable to production, transportation and retail of these goods. However, we treat direct CO$_{2}$-emissions as zero, in line with assumptions by the IPCC (REF MISSING).
\end{itemize}

We homogenize information on household characteristics across countries, for example for main cooking fuels, lighting fuels and heating fuels. If available, we collect information on household-level appliance and vehicle ownership and electricity access. We also include information on sociodemographic characteristics (including gender of household head, education of household head, self-identified ethnicity, nationality, language or religion).
We assign household to expenditure quintiles based on total household expenditures per capita to account for differing expenditure shares in larger households. 

Tables \ref{tab:A1}, \ref{tab:A2}, \ref{tab:A3}, \ref{tab:A4_CF}, \ref{tab:A5_LF} and \ref{tab:A6} show summary statistics for our final homogenized dataset. 

% tracking and documenting removals

\subsection{Feature engineering} \label{sec:featureengineering}

Building on our homogenized dataset, we perform feature engineering on our variables (features) before performing analyses with BRT.

\begin{itemize}
    \item We exclude any feature with missing variation (for four countries).
    \item We exclude categorical feature with extremely high granularity (such as district-level identifiers).
    \item We exclude any feature with missing values.
    \item We remove the minimum number of features necessary to avoid high levels of correlation ($r>0.9$) between all features.
    \item We code observations as "other" for each feature (except province-level, district-level and urban-/rural-identifiers) that account for less than 5\% of all observations.
    \item All country-level feature sets include total household expenditures (in US-\$ 2017) and household size. The minimum number of included features is X (for Y) and the maximum number of included feature is X (for Z).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Policy simulation}\label{sec:policysimulation}

We show that heterogeneity in household-level carbon intensity of consumption is equivalent to heterogeneity in household-level carbon pricing incidence, assuming that producers pass-on carbon prices to consumers and that the carbon pricing incidence reflects over-night costs to households without demand responses.

The carbon intensity of consumption $e_{i}$ consists of sectoral carbon intensities and household-level sectoral expenditure shares as shown in equation \ref{eq:ei}. 

Carbon pricing can be thought of a tax $\tau$ in USD/tCO$_{2}$ and the total absolute costs from carbon pricing equals direct and indirect carbon emissions embedded in household consumption $E_{i}$ multiplied with $\tau$. Computing total relative costs $CPI_{i}$ requires division by total household expenditures $C_{i}$:

\begin{equation}
    CPI_{i} = \frac{E_{i}*\tau}{C_{i}}
\end{equation}

Relative additional costs, i.e., the carbon pricing incidence CPI$_{i}$ can be expressed in \% ($\frac{USD_{\tau}}{USD_{i}}$). CPI$_{i}$ is equivalent to our expression for carbon intensity of consumption $e_{i}$, scaled by a proportional factor $\tau$. If $e_{A}=2*e_{B}$, then $CPI_{A}=2*CPI_{B}$, assuming that $e_{A}$ and $e_{B}$ express the carbon intensity covering all nationally released CO$_{2}$-emissions for households A and B and that $CPI_{A}$ and $CPI_{B}$ refer to the relative carbon pricing incidence for a carbon price levied on all nationally released emissions in households A and B, respectively.

Our modelling framework also allows for the simulation of other (sectoral) policies. Consider a carbon price in a specific sector, e.g., in the transport sector, here denoted as $\tau_{s^{*}}$. Such a sector-specific tax would cover all direct and indirect emissions released in this sector $s^{*}$, but not emissions released in other sectors. Nevertheless, prices of consumption goods and services from sectors other than transport would still increase because of embedded emissions from the transport sector.

Calculating additional sets of sectoral carbon intensities $e_{s^{*}}$ including direct and indirect emissions of different sectors can help to simulate the impact of sectoral policies. Effectively, we only include direct and indirect CO$_{2}$-emissions released in sectors $s^{*}$.

It is also possible to investigate the distribution of regional policies, for example of carbon border taxes covering CO$_{2}$-emissions for imported goods and services.
