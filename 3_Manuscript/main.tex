\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

\begin{itemize}
  % One paragraph on setting the scene
  \item Many criteria influence the evaluation of different policy instruments, including efficiency, effectiveness, tractability, institutional feasibility, but also political feasibility, including equity and fairness. One important aspect are distributional implications. In the context of climate policy people may ask: Who loses from climate policy and why?
  % Highlight discourse on public acceptance, possibly on just transitions etc.
  \item Distributional effects of climate policy instruments hinge on many aspects, including household-specific ability to substitute away from carbon-intensive goods and services, industries' ability to reduce emissions-intensive inputs, and household-level price elasticities of demand.
  % One paragraph becoming more specific
  \item Some policy instruments are considered superior with regard to aggregate cost-effectiveness, but might require supplementary measures, such as subsidies, allowances, or transfers to address unintended distributional consequences for households.
  \item One important metric that helps assessing the impacts of climate policy is the carbon intensity of consumption or production. For households, the carbon intensity expresses the amount of $CO_{2}$-emissions that link to the consumption of consumed goods and services per unit of expenditure. The carbon intensity of consumption gives an accurate approximation of the cost burden resulting from any policy instrument that directly or indirectly increases the price of $CO_{2}$-emissions.
  \item Households that consume more carbon-intensive than others spend relatively more money on carbon-intensive goods and services, such as transport fuels, heating fuels, cooking fuels, or electricity.
  \item Evidence suggests many socio-economic socio-demographic characteristics to drive or correlate with more carbon-intensive consumption.
  % One paragraph outlining the research gap
  \item Ex-ante economic assessments often focus on single-country or -policy contexts or aggregated cross-country analyses. What is missing is a systematic cross-country analyses with detailed household-level information.
\end{itemize}

% One paragraph stating the research question

In this study, we analyze the heterogeneity in carbon intensity of consumption within countries and compare results across countries. Transgressing traditional analyses of vertical and horizontal heterogeneity, we study country-level household characteristics that correlate with and drive the carbon intensity of consumption. We construct a unique dataset on household-level carbon intensity of consumption for 1.5 million single households representative for 5 billion people in 86 countries that comprise 68\% of global GDP and 52\% of global $CO_{2}$-emissions.

% One paragraph sketching findings

% One paragraph outlining contribution

%\item Our analysis informs further research on potential drivers of carbon emissions and inequality in carbon-intensive consumption. It might inform policy to develop international, but also national complementary measures to combat unintended effects of effective climate mitigation policies.

% Roadmap paragraph ?


\section{Vertical and horizontal inequality of climate policy} \label{sec:literature}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Introducing vertical and horizontal inequality
  \item Three paragraphs on distributional impacts of climate policy (theoretical arguments, one on broad relevance, one on price-based policies, one on standards, subsidies, behavioural interventions)
  \item Two paragraphs on distributional impacts of climate policy (empirical studies, mainly on price-based policies, also on standards, subsidies, behavioural interventions)
  \item One paragraph on macro-level studies on carbon inequality (within countries)

\end{itemize}

\section{Analyzing heterogeneity in carbon intensity of consumption} \label{sec:methods}

\begin{itemize}

    \item Introduce carbon intensity of consumption as major indicator
    \item Show that carbon intensity is equivalent to first-order carbon pricing incidence
    \item Show that sector-specific carbon intensities can help to learn about other policies
    \item Argue backwards: Carbon intensity of consumption consists of household expenditure shares and sectoral carbon intensities
    \item Household expenditure shares: Data, cleaning, homogenizing and shortcomings
    \item Sectoral carbon intensities: Data, method, intuition and shortcomings
    \item Methodological discussion (brief)
    \item Analyzing vertical inequality
    \item Analyzing horizontal inequality
    \item Introduce boosted regression trees
    \item Introduce logit model as robustness check, supplementary analysis
    \item Critical appraisal

\end{itemize}

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Summary statistics
  \item Show differences between poor and rich households.
  \item Show differences within poor and rich households.
  \item One figure: One country (quintiles and boxplots), all countries (poorest quintile and between-quintile differences), all countries (vertical over horizontal inequality)
  \item Within-quintile differences exceed between-quintile differences
  \item Horizontal heterogeneity even more pronounced than vertical heterogeneity in majority of countries
  \item Households that consume more carbon-intensively than others are poorer than others in richer countries and richer than others in poorer countries. Explain basic intuition.
  \item If within-quintile differences exceed between-quintile differences using differences in income as a main indicator for evaluating heterogeneity is insufficient.
  \item Learning about the most carbon-intensively consuming households and their characteristics (beyond income) is important.
  \item Discuss main arguments for single characteristics (possibly already in methods section).
  \item Show results for different characteristics.
  \item One figure: One country (Marginal effects from Logit-model), Shapley-values from boosted regression trees
  \item One figure: Comparing marginal effects from Logit-model across countries
  \item More carbon-intensive households are more likely to own (and use) a car, more likely to use fossil fuels for cooking, such as coal, gas, or LPG, less likely to use firewood, charcoal or biomass for cooking, compared to households cooking with electricity. More likely connected to the electricity grid, more likely to have secondary or higher education, more likely to live in rural areas (in richer countries). Discuss differences in space, across provinces and districts. Depending on the country-context, they are more/less likely to identify with ethnic majorities or minorities.
  \item Comparing model outcomes across countries. One figure: A: Show classification for single countries with colour codes (order in clusters). B: Show clustering of countries with colour codes.
  \item Discuss differences in instruments: electricity sector instruments, transport sector instruments, international trade policy etc. Highlight main differences: electricity sector characteristics and electrification critical for electricity sector instruments, transport sector policies likely regressive in richer countries, progressive in poorer countries, carbon border adjustments more likely to affect people who consume more carbon-intensive and imported goods and services. Non-consumption impacts probably more severe. (If anything, possibly also Appendix. I suggest the figure comparing vertical and horizontal aspects here).
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Discuss role of findings for design of different policies (standards, subsidies, brief)
 \item Discuss role of findings for design of transfers
 \item Discuss ``value chain of climate policy implementation''. Discuss literature on public acceptance. Highlight research gaps: Which distributional implications matter to households and why? How could compensation increase public support? Public support of which groups matter for people with political power?
 \item Discuss dynamic effects and inaccuracies in modeling approach (tax pass-through, short- vs. medium-term, technological path dependencies/barriers on household-level)
 \item Distinguish results from analyses about climate policy on labour, wealth, impacts, adaptation, co-benefits, co-costs.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Differences in income one important criterion for comparing outcomes across groups.
 \item Misses important parts of the picture. Necessary to factor in other characteristics.
 \item More nuanced analyses can help to facilitate discussion on acceptable climate policy.
\end{itemize}
