\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

% Setting the scene: Understanding distributional impacts are important because they matter to people.
Both policymakers and the public often judge a policy by its distributional implications. One reason for this is that the distribution of policy-induced costs across household groups can influence overall public acceptance and thus the political feasibility of policy reforms. In the context of climate change mitigation, unintended and heterogeneous policy impacts on households have been associated with public resistance \autocite{MaestreAndres.2019,Dechezlepretre.2022}, ultimately limiting the implementation of efficient and effective mitigation policies \autocite{Clements.2013,Douenne.2020c}.

% Setting the scene 2: Why it is important to understand the distributional impacts of climate policy --> design of transfers.
In theory, it is possible to alleviate distributional impacts by complementing climate policy with compensation policies. In practice, however, governments face important information constraints. It is often unclear ex ante how the costs of climate policy will be distributed across households, whether the use of existing compensation policies will be sufficient to address these costs, and what new instruments would be needed to achieve any distribution of costs that is politically desirable. In particular, large horizontal heterogeneity can reduce the effectiveness of oft-proposed lump-sum transfers. Effective compensation, however, i.e., minimizing targeting errors, is important to advance public support for climate policy and to ease fiscal pressures. Yet, our understanding of which compensation policies would be effective in achieving which distribution of costs \textit{post}-compensation is crude.

% Research question
In this study, we analyze the heterogeneous impacts of climate policy instruments on households in 88 countries. We go beyond traditional analyses of vertical and horizontal heterogeneity and use supervised machine learning to disentangle the non-linear contribution of household characteristics to variation in the carbon intensity of consumption. The carbon intensity of consumption serves as an accurate representation of the short-term additional costs of climate policy, at least for any policy instrument that increases the marginal cost of emitting CO\textsubscript{2}.

% One paragraph sketching findings
We show that across the entire sample, horizontal differences in carbon intensity within income groups exceed vertical differences between income groups. Heterogeneity in income, proxied by total household expenditures, is often insufficient by itself to predict heterogeneity in carbon intensity. Instead, other important household characteristics beyond household expenditures include vehicle ownership, information on household location, and energy use, such as main cooking and heating fuels and appliance ownership. Including such characteristics in our models substantially improves our prediction of households' carbon intensity. Our results point to country- and policy-specific distributional impacts that call for compensation policies tailored to each country context if households are to be effectively compensated for additional costs, thereby reducing horizontal heterogeneity. 

% One paragraph outlining contribution
Our contribution to a more comprehensive assessment of the heterogeneous impacts of climate policy is threefold: First, we compile a novel and harmonized dataset on the carbon intensity of consumption at the household level. Our dataset contains granular information on 1.5 million individual households, representing more than 5 billion people in 88 countries. In contrast, previous work often focuses on single-country contexts or neglects within-country characteristics at the household level. Second, we use supervised machine learning to identify non-linear relationships between household characteristics and carbon intensity of consumption, while the (nascent) literature on horizontal heterogeneity focuses primarily on linear models. Third, we identify different clusters of countries based on the model results. Countries in the same cluster are more similar to each other with respect to factors associated with the heterogeneity in carbon intensity. This approach contributes to a more systematic understanding of similarities and differences in country-specific characteristics of distributional impacts. % Cross-country learning not really possible.

% Roadmap paragraph
% We proceed as follows: In Chapter \ref{sec:literature}, we formally describe the decision problem of the government with respect to choice of climate policy and compensation measures in light of associated distributional impacts.
We proceed as follows: In Chapter \ref{sec:literature}, we present a theoretical framework describing the distributional impacts of climate policy and their relevance for governments to design complementary compensation policies. In Chapter \ref{sec:data_methods}, we present our modeling approach, which combines household budget survey and multi-regional input-output data. We present empirical methods to describe both within-country heterogeneity and cross-country similarities. In Chapter \ref{sec:results}, we analyze the vertical and horizontal distributional effects of climate policy, describe the relative importance of household characteristics for predicting carbon intensity at the country level, and cluster countries when household characteristics are similarly important. Finally, we discuss our findings in light of ongoing debates about how to avoid or address unintended distributional impacts of climate policy in Chapter \ref{sec:discussion} before concluding in Chapter \ref{sec:conclusion}.  

%\section{Literature: Vertical and horizontal distributional impacts of climate policy} \label{sec:literature}
\section{Theoretical framework: Distributional impacts of climate policy} \label{sec:literature}

We present a theoretical framework that incorporates the decision problem of a government faced with heterogeneous impacts of climate policy across households. We integrate several aspects from research on the distributional implications of climate policy to motivate our core research questions. Similar approaches in political economy research describe the role of heterogeneous interest groups for governments to enact climate policies \autocite{Aidt.1998,Fredriksson.1997}. In addition, we consider the ability of governments to ease additional costs and their unequal distribution through compensation policies \autocite{Lindbeck.1987,Aidt.2010,Cremer.2004}. In contrast to such approaches, which consider governments to maximize aggregate welfare, vote shares, or contributions by interest groups, we assume that governments maximize public acceptance \autocite[e.g.,][]{Downs.1957,Stigler.1971} when faced with the choice of climate and compensation policies. 

\paragraph{Choice of climate policy} 
We consider the government of any country \textit{r} with an exogenous target to reduce CO\textsubscript{2} emissions. This implies that we ignore government preferences for more stringent climate policy, as well as the benefits of abated climate change and their distribution across households. Governments can achieve their target by introducing one or more novel climate policy instruments $p \in P$. Such instruments can differ in many dimensions, including cost-efficiency, transaction costs, or institutional requirements, but here we focus on household acceptance as the relevant criterion for influencing governments' choice of a policy or combination of policies.

The introduction of climate policy \textit{p} leads to additional costs $c_{i,p}<0$ in household \textit{i}. This proposition is reasonable for demand-side policies, but also for supply-side policies, assuming that firms pass on additional costs to households. We therefore neglect the distribution of costs across regulated industries. We also focus on changes in consumption costs, neglecting effects of climate policy on wages or wealth. Variable $c_{i,p}$ refers to the \textit{relative} additional costs (in \% of household income), reflecting the diminishing marginal utility of income.

The relative additional costs $c_{p}$ differ for different households, where $\psi(c_{p})$ represents heterogeneity in household-level costs. Differences in $c_{p}$ express both household-level differences in income and access to (and use of) less polluting technologies \autocite{Hansel.2022}: Relative additional costs are higher for lower-income households for equal access to less polluting technologies and for households with equal levels of income that use more of the regulated polluting technology. More specifically, relative additional costs reflect expenditure shares for polluting goods, which differ with income \autocite{Jacobs.2019,Dorband.2019}. Both household income and the use of less polluting technologies are part of a set of household characteristics $X_{i}$. 

Governments thus choose a set of climate policy instruments $P^{\prime}$ that leads to household-specific costs $c_{i,P^{\prime}}$ and resulting heterogeneity $\psi(c_{P^{\prime}})$ determined by household heterogeneity in income and technology use.

\paragraph{Choice of compensation policy}
In addition, governments can introduce one or more compensation policies $t \in T$, which is a frequently proposed option to address unintended costs of climate policy \autocite{Klenert.2018,Baranzini.2017}. Such compensation policies include household-level benefits $b_{i,t}>0$ that depend on household characteristics $X^{\prime}$ \autocite[e.g.,][]{Akerlof.1978}. For example, one option is to reduce income taxes, which has its merits on efficiency grounds \autocite{Pearce.1991,Goulder.1995,Bento.2018}. In our framework, this would lead to compensation benefits $b_{i,t}$ differentiated by income in household \textit{i}. Importantly, governments can only observe a subset $X^{\prime}$ of household characteristics \textit{X}, and compensation policies are only available for such observable characteristics\footnote{For example, governments can compensate households by lowering taxes on vehicle ownership or transport fuel consumption, which are observable. They may not compensate households by linking benefits to environmental attitudes or the use of efficient appliances.}. 

Compensation policies that are targeted based on household characteristics pose a challenge for governments to ensure that transfers reach households eligible for compensation \autocite[e.g.,][]{Hanna.2018}. Research addressing the design of transfers in the absence of information on recipients confirms that such \textit{targeting errors} can be substantial, especially in non-industrialized countries \autocite{WorldBank.2018, Robles.2019,Bah.2019}. Reasons for this include limited institutional capacity \autocite[e.g.,][]{Besley.2009} and higher administrative costs \autocite{Coady.2004} required to improve precision.

One alternative is a compensation that is not conditional on household characteristics $X^{\prime}$, e.g., a uniform lump-sum transfer. Indeed, a uniform lump-sum transfer is a popular recommendation in the case of climate policy \autocite{Stiglitz.2017,Baranzini.2000,Metcalf.2009,Sager.2023}, precisely because governments require little information about the recipients and because such transfers feature easing the costs for poorer households \autocite{Budolfson.2021,vanderPloeg.2022}. 

If such transfers were not available, governments could resort to other theoretically conceivable compensation policies that are not conditional on household characteristics: Financing public infrastructure may help promote development goals \autocite{Franks.2018,Jakob.2016}, subsidizing or providing subsistence goods (including energy) may prevent adverse effects on the poorest households \autocite{Greve.2022,Schaffitzel.2019}, and green spending may lead to increased public support \autocite{Sommer.2022,Kotchen.2017,Dechezlepretre.2022}. We denote benefits from transfers that are not conditional on household characteristics by $b_{i,\varepsilon}$.

We assume that governments finance compensation policies through an exogenously given budget. Thus, we neglect administrative costs of implementing each climate or compensation policy, application costs at the household level, and strict budget constraints\footnote{Nevertheless, this framework could in principle be used to calculate how much budget should be spent to increase targeting precision, assuming that heterogeneity in the costs of climate policy should be reduced to a minimum. Including a strict budget constraint may also serve the purpose of testing the potential of revenue-generating, but \textit{revenue-neutral} climate policy instruments (such as carbon pricing or fossil fuel subsidy reforms) to reduce additional costs to households.}. 

\paragraph{The na\text{\"i}ve incidence on households}
The difference between the costs of climate policy and the benefits of compensation policy leads to a na\text{\"i}ve incidence $\pi_{i}$ in household \textit{i}, where

\begin{equation} \label{eq:pi}
    \pi_{i} = \underbrace{\sum_{P^{\prime}} c_{i,P^{\prime}}}_{\text{costs from climate policy}} + \underbrace{\sum_{T} b_{i,T} + b_{i,\varepsilon}}_{\text{benefits from compensation policy}}
\end{equation}

This household-specific incidence $\pi_{i}$, i.e., the net relative budget change, can be positive or negative, and depends on the governments' choice of climate and compensation policy instruments. The heterogeneity in such incidence across households thus depends on the prevailing heterogeneity in additional costs $\psi(c_{P^{\prime}})$ and on the choice of transfers by governments. The minimum heterogeneity that governments can achieve is limited by whether the additional costs $c_{P^{\prime}}$ are correlated with observable household characteristics $X^{\prime}$. This correlation affects whether compensation can help reduce heterogeneity across households. Nevertheless, we assume that household characteristics $X^{\prime}$ are exogenous: Households cannot change their household characteristics in the short term, e.g., by improving home insulation or reducing demand for emission-intensive modes of transport. This implies that expectations about the short-term incidence of households $\pi_{i}$ cannot influence household characteristics $X_{i}$.

\paragraph{Distributional effects of climate policy}
An important determinant for public acceptance is equity. Our \textit{na\text{\"i}ve} expression of households' incidence captures the short-term net budget change, but does not take into account whether households perceive this incidence to be acceptable \textit{in comparison} to other households. We therefore introduce two additive terms in our framework that account for households' perceptions of distributional effects. 

We start with \textit{vertical} distributional effects, which describe differences in additional costs between income groups. Let \textit{q} refer to income groups and $V_{i}$ to the importance of vertical differences for household \textit{i}, expressed in monetary terms:

\begin{equation}\label{eq_V}
    V_{i} = \sum_{q_{j}} \delta_{i,q_{j}}^{V} * (\overline{\pi_{q_{i}}}-\overline{\pi_{q_{j}}}) \text{ with } q_{i} \neq q_{j}  
\end{equation}

$\overline{\pi_{q_{i}}}$ denotes the median additional costs in income group $q_{i}$. Variable $\delta_{i,q_{j}}^{V}$ expresses the sensitivity of household \textit{i} to vertical differences between its income group $q_{i}$ and other income groups $q_{j}$. For example, it is reasonable to assume that households are interested in comparing the median additional costs of relatively poorer or richer households, i.e., whether a policy would lead to progressive or regressive outcomes \autocite[e.g.,][]{Dechezlepretre.2022}. $\delta_{i,q_{j}}^{V}$ can be thought of as a measure of inequality aversion at the household level, indicating how much money each household would be willing to spend to reduce vertical heterogeneity.

Many researchers have studied the vertical distributional effects of climate policy instruments, i.e., heterogeneity in policy outcomes between relatively poorer and relatively richer households\footnote{Our study is also related to research that compares within-country heterogeneity in carbon-intensive consumption across countries and time. For example, \textcite{Chancel.2022b} creates a time series of carbon footprints at the level of countries and percentiles, including in particular household investment decisions, and finds that \textit{carbon inequality} within countries has increased over the last thirty years. Others \autocite{Oswald.2020,Bruckner.2022} compare the distribution of carbon footprints across and within countries, but such macro-level studies tend to be silent on policy impacts and their associated vertical and horizontal distributional implications.}. For price-based climate policy instruments (such as carbon pricing), such work includes analyses in single countries \autocite{Poterba.1991,Goulder.2019,Grainger.2010,Rausch.2011,Garaffa.2021,Sterner.2012,Wu.2022} or across countries \autocite{Budolfson.2021,Feindt.2021,Dorband.2019,Steckel.2021b,VogtSchilb.2019,Missbach.2024}. Price-based policies covering all sectors are often found to be regressive, especially in high-income countries. In contrast, a meta-analysis \autocite{Ohlendorf.2021} documents more progressive results in lower-income countries and for price-based policies aimed at the transport sector.

Another strand of research explores vertical distributional impacts for other climate policy instruments, such as fossil fuel subsidy removal \autocite{Schaffitzel.2019,Giuliano.2020,DelArzeGranado.2012}, technology standards \autocite{Levinson.2019,Zhao.2022,Bruegge.2019}, subsidies for cleaner goods \autocite{Borenstein.2016,Vaishnav.2017,Winter.2019}, and behavioral interventions \autocite{DellaValle.2020,Liebe.2021}. Essentially, all policy instruments are found to have some vertical distributional effects, reflecting heterogeneous preferences for and endowments with less polluting technologies across different income groups. 

A second important dimension is \textit{horizontal} distributional effects, i.e., differences in additional costs among similarly poor or similarly rich households \autocite{Rausch.2011,Fischer.2019}. Let $H_{i}$ denote the importance of horizontal differences for household \textit{i}, expressed in monetary terms:

\begin{equation}\label{eq_H}
    H_{i} = \sum_{q} \delta_{i,q}^{H} * H_{q}
\end{equation}

$H_{q}$ denotes differences in additional costs within income groups. One measure of $H_{q}$ can be the difference between the 5\textsuperscript{th} and 95\textsuperscript{th} percentiles in each income group, i.e., $H_{q}=\pi_{q}^{95}-\pi_{q}^{5}$. Variable $\delta_{i,q}^{H}$ expresses the sensitivity of household \textit{i} to horizontal differences within income groups. This measure also reflects the relative position of household \textit{i} in its income group $q_{i}$, e.g., $\frac{\pi_{i,q}}{\overline{\pi_{q}}}$. Similarly, variable $\delta_{i,q}^{H}$ can be thought of as a measure of inequality aversion at the household level, indicating how much money each household would be willing to spend to reduce horizontal heterogeneity.

Researchers have begun to take an interest in the horizontal distributional effects of climate policy, partly as a result of the empirical observation that variation \textit{within} income groups can differ more strongly than \textit{between} them \autocite{Cronin.2019,Steckel.2021b,Pizer.2019}. Such horizontal differences indicate that households use technologies with heterogeneous carbon intensity, but such differences in available technologies cannot be attributed to heterogeneous levels of household wealth \autocite{Hansel.2022}. The analysis of the determinants of horizontal distributional effects is receiving increasing attention: Research highlights the role of energy use patterns \autocite{Steckel.2021b,Missbach.2024}, differences in the spatial dimension \autocite{Chan.2023,Burtraw.2009}, and sociodemographic variables (such as household size, education, ethnicity, and occupation \autocite{Grainger.2010,Buchs.2013,Farrell.2017,Missbach.2023,Fremstad.2019}) for horizontal heterogeneity, but compared to research on the drivers of vertical distributional effects, such analyses remain scarce.

Horizontal distributional effects are particularly important for the design of compensation policies. For example, combining price-based climate policies with revenue-neutral and uniform lump-sum transfers would lead to a more progressive distribution of additional costs, but would neglect or even increase horizontal differences within income groups \autocite{Cronin.2019,Hansel.2022}. This is because such undifferentiated transfers would not compensate those households that would bear the highest additional costs \autocite{Fullerton.2019,Missbach.2024,Sallee.2019}. Instead, reducing horizontal heterogeneity may justify differentiated transfers.

\paragraph{The government decision problem}
Our theoretical framework features the static decision of governments to choose a set of climate and compensation policies that maximizes public acceptance when faced with an exogenous target to reduce CO\textsubscript{2} emissions. Maintaining public acceptance or support can be seen as a core objective of governments, and research suggests that lack of public acceptance has been detrimental to effective climate policy implementation \autocite{Carattini.2018,Bergquist.2022,Douenne.2022}.

We assume that governments are primarily concerned with the short-term effects of policies and public acceptance. We ignore the intertemporal dimension and neglect the dynamic responses of households to climate and compensation policies, which may alter the additional costs and their distribution\footnote{The medium-term costs to households depend critically on substitution elasticities and thus implicitly on available technologies and existing infrastructure.}. We express the government decision problem as follows:  

\begin{equation} \label{eq:theta}
    \max_{P^{\prime},T} \Theta = \sum_{i} \mu_{i} * \rho_{i}(\pi_{i} + V_{i} + H_{i})
\end{equation}

The term $(\pi_{i} + V_{i} + H_{i})$ expresses the cost of a set of climate and compensation policies $P^{\prime}$ and \textit{T} for household \textit{i}, including the na\text{\"i}ve incidence and households' aversion to vertical or horizontal distributional effects. Such costs are the argument to function $\rho_{i}(\bullet)$ that reflects each household's loss aversion \autocite{Tversky.1991} and helps translate monetary costs into a measure of acceptance. $\mu_{i}$ denotes weights of the government for each household's acceptance to reflect that governments may seek higher acceptance from certain interest groups than from others.

It is important to note that $\mu_{i}$ is a normative term that expresses governments' preferences for accepting or declining a particular distribution of the costs of climate policy. For example, it could reflect that governments prefer climate policy instruments with the least distributive distortions \autocite{Fischer.2019} or that governments reject policies that increase inequality \textit{per se}. By comparison, variables $\delta_{i,q_{j}}^{V}$, $\delta_{i,q}^{H}$, and function $\rho_{i}(\bullet)$ are positive household-level terms that describe households' perceptions of fairness and their willingness to accept climate policy costs. We treat such terms as exogenous, leaving them to various strands of research on household-level loss aversion and perceptions of fairness. 

In essence, governments face a trade-off between efficiency and equity \autocite{Hansel.2022,TerryDinan.2016} because some households have access to less carbon-intensive technologies and others do not, implying that efficiency-enhancing climate policies may lead to increased inequality. Equation \ref{eq:theta} shows that maximizing public acceptance of climate policy requires easing additional costs to households and their unequal distribution. Governments have the option of choosing complementary compensation policies, and Equation \ref{eq:pi} shows that effective design of such compensation policies requires precise information about household-level characteristics that help explain differences in additional costs. 

Following our theoretical framework, we contribute to a better understanding of the distributional impacts of climate policy and the requirements for effective compensation policies. First, we analyze the distribution of the costs of climate policy instruments, i.e., we are interested in $\psi(c_{p})$. The distribution of such costs depends on the distribution of income and less polluting technologies, which leads us to analyze $\psi(c_{p})$ at the country level and for a wide range of countries and policy instruments with different regional or sectoral coverage. Second, we systematically describe the vertical and horizontal distributional effects of climate policy, i.e., we compare additional costs across and within income groups. Third, we analyze which compensating policies would be effective in solving the government decision problem by reducing vertical and, in particular, horizontal distributional effects. Implicitly, we ask: Which household characteristics $X^{\prime}$ can help explain the variation in additional costs $c_{p}$? This may have different implications for climate and compensation policies across countries if different household characteristics are associated with variation in the additional costs of climate policy.    

% Show why distributional impacts can happen (theoretical arguments).
% Accordingly, there is a long-standing tradition in the economic literature that assesses distributional effects of environmental policy reforms \autocite{Cremer.2003,Poterba.1991,Sandmo.1975,Stiglitz.2019}. As a general result, households that consume more of a polluting good can expect higher absolute costs when pollution becomes more expensive. Relative additional costs depend on expenditure shares for polluting goods, which differ with income \autocite{Jacobs.2019,Dorband.2019}. Above all, the distribution of such additional costs depends on the distribution of less-polluting technology. If some households have access to less carbon-intensive technologies and others do not, then climate policy may lead to increasing inequality, posing a difficult trade-off between efficiency and equity \autocite{Hansel.2022,TerryDinan.2016}. 

% Demonstrate gap and highlight contribution
% Building on these findings, our paper provides a comprehensive analysis of vertical and horizontal distributional impacts of climate policy for a broad set of countries. It contributes by highlighting the limitations of prevalent approaches to assess climate policies most prominently with respect to its \textit{vertical} distributional implications. Explicitly accounting for household characteristics beyond income or total expenditures, our paper analyzes characteristics associated with heterogeneous costs of policies. Our flexible modelling framework allows for the simulation of different policies - including, but not limited to price-based policies such as carbon pricing - and can help to inform about potential complementing compensation policies that are likely effective in addressing heterogeneous policy impacts on households.

\section{Data and methods} \label{sec:data_methods}

% Introduce carbon intensity of consumption as major indicator
We derive the heterogeneous costs of climate policy on households by analyzing the heterogeneity in the carbon intensity of consumption: Assume that the consumption of household \textit{A} is twice as carbon-intensive as the consumption of household \textit{B}, then climate policy will lead to twice as high costs for household \textit{A} compared to household \textit{B} and relative to total expenditures\footnote{This proposition holds under the assumption that climate policy raises supply-side input prices in line with the \textit{embedded} CO\textsubscript{2} emissions associated with production, and that firms cannot respond to changing input prices in the short term. As a corollary, output prices for consumer goods and services would increase in proportion  to embedded (direct and indirect) CO\textsubscript{2} emissions. More generally, the carbon intensity reflects the additional cost of any policy that increases consumer prices in proportion to embedded CO\textsubscript{2} emissions, independent of existing policies. A visible example is an upstream carbon tax. See also Appendix \ref{sec:policysimulation}.}.

In this chapter, we first describe the construction of a novel dataset that captures household-level carbon intensities across countries\footnote{Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:data_visualisation} visualizes key elements of our data work and analyses.}. We then describe how to explore and compare the vertical and horizontal heterogeneity in carbon intensities. We also present our approach to analyzing such heterogeneity with supervised machine learning, which helps unravel the contribution of individual household characteristics to predicting households' carbon intensity.

\subsection{Household-level carbon intensities: A novel dataset} \label{sec:data}

The carbon intensity of consumption of household \textit{i}, denoted by $e_{i}$, is the variable of interest in this study. It reflects both direct and indirect\footnote{Direct CO\textsubscript{2} emissions refer to emissions resulting from the combustion of fuels in households, e.g., for transportation or heating. Indirect CO\textsubscript{2} emissions refer to emissions that can be attributed to the production, transportation, and retail of all goods and services purchased by each household, such as emissions from electricity generation or manufacturing processes.} CO\textsubscript{2} emissions $E_{i}$ in household \textit{i} relative to total consumption $C_{i}$ and thus the additional cost of climate policy at the household level $c_{i,p}$, as described in Chapter \ref{sec:literature}. We express $e_{i}$ in $\frac{kgCO_{2}}{USD}$. More specifically, the carbon intensity of consumption represents the carbon intensities of different sectors $e_{s}$, weighted by the expenditure shares in household \textit{i} for goods and services from each sector \textit{s}, denoted as $w_{i,s}$:

% Argue backwards: Carbon intensity of consumption consists of household expenditure shares and sectoral carbon intensities

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ei}
e_{i} = \frac{E_{i}}{C_{i}} = \frac{\sum_{s} e_{s}*C_{i,s}}{\sum_{s} C_{i,s}} = \sum_{s} e_{s}*w_{i,s}

Examining the carbon intensity at the household level for different sectors \textit{s}, denoted by $e_{i,s}$, allows for understanding the heterogeneous impacts of different policies \textit{p} with different sectoral or regional coverage, such as policies targeting the transport or electricity sectors, or trade policies such as carbon border adjustments.

%  Household expenditure shares: Data, cleaning, homogenizing and shortcomings
\paragraph{Sectoral expenditure shares} We collect information on sectoral expenditure shares at the household level ($w_{i,s}=\frac{C_{i,s}}{\sum_{s}C_{i,s}}$) from household budget surveys (see Table \ref{tab:datasets} for an overview). In such surveys, households report their expenditure on goods and services at the item level, from which we compute sectoral expenditure shares\footnote{We match consumption items to sectors using matching tables. We share all matching tables through a stable online data repository. See Appendix \ref{code}. Figure \ref{fig:Engel} shows country-level Engel curves for energy, goods, services, and food.}. We include survey datasets in our study if they cover a nationally representative sample, include item-level expenditure information, and if the surveys were conducted between 2010 and 2019\footnote{We exclude more recent survey data, where available, to account for potential biases induced by large economic shocks, such as those associated with Covid-19.}. After several cleaning steps\footnote{Appendices \ref{sec:cleaning_1} and \ref{sec:cleaning_2} list details on cleaning and on our efforts to harmonize household characteristics across countries.}, our resulting dataset contains information on more than 1.5 million individual households representative of the populations of 88 countries that account for more than 5 billion people, 68\% of global GDP, and 51\% of global CO\textsubscript{2} emissions\footnote{We calculate these figures using data for population, GDP, and CO\textsubscript{2} emissions from the World Development Indicators Database \autocite{WorldBankGroup.2023} for 2019.}.

We include total household expenditures as a surrogate for household income in our dataset because total household expenditures are a better proxy for \textit{lifetime} income \autocite{Poterba.1989,Poterba.1991,Cronin.2019} and because wage data from such surveys are often unreliable \autocite{Blundell.1998}. In the remainder of the study, we consider total household expenditures and income as synonyms\footnote{Nevertheless, we acknowledge the documented differences between using expenditure or income data to calculate carbon footprints \autocite[see][]{Levay.2023}.}.

In addition, our dataset includes sociodemographic information on household members (such as education, gender, nationality, main language, self-identified ethnicity, or religion of household representatives), detailed spatial information (such as province, district, or village of households), and information on energy use (such as the main fuels used for cooking, lighting, and heating) or appliance and vehicle ownership. Such household-level information (including total household expenditures) forms the set of variables $X_{i}^{'}$, which allows the analysis of differences between households with different characteristics\footnote{Table \ref{tab:A1} shows summary statistics for all countries in our sample; Table \ref{tab:A2} shows average household expenditures and average energy expenditure shares for each expenditure quintile and each country. We also show the proportions of households that use different cooking fuels (Table \ref{tab:A4_CF}) and lighting fuels (Table \ref{tab:A5_LF}), and that own various major appliances (Table \ref{tab:A6}) for all countries for which such data are available.}.

% Sectoral carbon intensities: Data, method, intuition and shortcomings
\paragraph{Sectoral carbon intensities} We complement expenditure share data with country- and sector-level carbon intensities $e_{s,r}$, which represent the  CO\textsubscript{2} emissions that can be directly or indirectly attributed to a unit of (household) consumption (in USD) from sector \textit{s} in region \textit{r}:

\begin{equation}
    e_{s,r} = \frac{E_{s,r}^{direct}+E_{s,r}^{indirect}}{\sum_{i} C_{i,s,r}}
\end{equation}

We derive total sectoral consumption ($\sum_{i} C_{i,s,r}$), direct ($E_{s}^{direct}$) and indirect ($E_{s}^{indirect}$) CO\textsubscript{2} emissions from  multi-regional input-output (MRIO) data. This approach is popular among researchers because it accounts for trade flows between different countries and regions, while providing sufficient detail for high sectoral resolution. 

We capitalize on trade data from the GTAP database \autocite[Version 11B, ][]{Aguiar.2022}, which we transform to MRIO data \autocite{Peters.2011}, reflecting input-output relationships between 65 sectors \textit{s} in 160 countries \textit{r}. We then compute the \textit{Leontief}-inverse $L_{r',s'}^{r,s}$, which captures information about the inputs required by each sector \textit{s'} and region \textit{r'} to produce one unit of output in each sector \textit{s} and region \textit{r}. We derive the indirect CO\textsubscript{2} emissions $E_{s}^{indirect}$ as follows\footnote{See \textcite{Missbach.2024, Steckel.2021b,Feindt.2021,VogtSchilb.2019} for a detailed description of this approach. The simulation of different sectoral and regional policies is possible by excluding different sectors \textit{s} or countries \textit{r}. 

Our flexible framework also allows us to analyze the impact of policies targeting non-CO\textsubscript{2} emissions, such as CH$_{4}$, N$_{2}$O, and F-gases. In our main analysis, we focus on national carbon intensities, i.e., how much CO\textsubscript{2} emissions resulting from production in each country can be attributed to a unit of output. This would be equivalent to zero carbon intensities for imported products, but reimported emissions would be included. See also Appendix \ref{sec:policysimulation}.}:

\begin{equation}
    E_{s}^{indirect} = \sum_{r'} \sum_{s'} e_{r',s'} L_{r',s'}^{r,s} C_{s}
\end{equation}

In addition, the GTAP database also includes information on direct CO\textsubscript{2} emissions $E_{s}^{direct}$. This covers CO\textsubscript{2} emissions resulting from the household-level use of fossil fuels, such as gasoline, natural gas, LPG, and hard coal.

Our result is a matrix containing information on the carbon intensities of (household) consumption $e_{s,r}$ for 65 sectors \textit{s} and 160 countries \textit{r}. These data reflect technologies, prices, and trade relations between sectors and countries for the year 2017. We show all country- and sector-level carbon intensities used in this study in Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:B}.

\paragraph{A novel cross-country dataset} 

Our resulting dataset integrates information on household characteristics and household expenditure shares with country- and sector-level carbon intensities, as described in Equation \ref{eq:ei}. Specifically, it consists of nationally representative accounts of the carbon intensity of household consumption $e_{i}$. Capturing detailed information on multiple household characteristics allows us to analyze heterogeneity in carbon intensity. To our knowledge, such a dataset linking household-level information to sectoral expenditure shares, weighted by country- and sector-level carbon intensities, is unprecedented and may help to inform more detailed policy analysis in the future\footnote{See Appendices \ref{data_availability} for more information about data availability and \ref{code} for information about code written for cleaning, modeling, and analysis.}.

\subsection{Descriptive analysis: Heterogeneity in carbon intensity} \label{sec:descriptive}

% Descriptive analysis 
We proceed with a descriptive analysis of the heterogeneity in carbon intensity of consumption to motivate our focus on the vertical and horizontal distributional impacts of climate policy at the country level.

Across all countries, the average carbon intensity of household consumption is 0.69 kgCO\textsubscript{2}/USD\footnote{It is important to note that our measure of carbon intensity of household consumption can differ from other carbon intensity measures in the literature, e.g., the average CO\textsubscript{2} emissions per GDP.  We base our analysis on household expenditure data and household expenditures can be substantially smaller than income, which leads to an increase in the carbon intensity of consumption. Nevertheless, our main analysis focuses on the heterogeneity of households' carbon intensity, which requires that household expenditure data express differences in expenditure shares at the household level and that MRIO data express differences in carbon intensities at the sector level.}. The average carbon intensity is highest for South Africa (2.04 kgCO\textsubscript{2}/USD), followed by Turkey (1.75 kgCO\textsubscript{2}/USD) and the Czech Republic (1.72 kgCO\textsubscript{2}/USD). The average carbon intensity is lowest for Malawi (0.03 kgCO\textsubscript{2}/USD), Rwanda (0.04 kgCO\textsubscript{2}/USD), Ethiopia and Niger (both 0.1 kgCO\textsubscript{2}/USD)\footnote{See Table \ref{tab:A3} for average carbon intensities for all countries.} \footnote{Country-level CO\textsubscript{2} intensities help to infer about the relative average costs of climate policy across countries: For example, a carbon price of USD 40 per tCO\textsubscript{2} \autocite{Stiglitz.2017} would be equivalent to an average relative cost of 2.76\% of total annual expenditure in a country with an average carbon intensity of 0.69 kgCO\textsubscript{2}/USD.}.

Analyses of the distributional impacts of climate policy often focus on comparing the average (or median) costs of policies for different income groups of households. A common approach is to assign households to income (or expenditure) quintiles to infer about vertical heterogeneity. More recently, researchers have also begun to compute measures of within-group heterogeneity, such as the 25\textsuperscript{th} or 75\textsuperscript{th} percentile within each expenditure quintile \autocite{Cronin.2019, Missbach.2024}. Comparing such percentile costs across expenditure quintiles can help to infer about horizontal heterogeneity.

Figure \ref{fig:fig_1} shows the distribution of carbon intensity of consumption among the poorest quintile in all countries in our sample. Boxes and whiskers contain 90\% of all households in each quintile and represent horizontal heterogeneity, i.e., differences among poorer households. In contrast, colored bars show the difference between the lowest and highest median carbon intensity across all quintiles for each country, describing vertical heterogeneity, i.e., differences between poorer and richer households\footnote{See Figure \ref{fig:Quint} for country-level comparisons across all expenditure quintiles and Table \ref{tab:A3} for summary statistics on carbon footprints and carbon intensity of consumption.}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{1_Figures/Figure 1/Figure_1_2017_11B.pdf}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{1_Figures/Figure 1/Legend Figure 1.pdf}
    \caption{Vertical differences and horizontal distribution of carbon intensity within poorest quintiles}
    \label{fig:fig_1}
    \begin{subcaption2}
    Boxplots show the horizontal distribution of carbon intensity at the household level within the poorest expenditure quintile in each of the 88 countries in our sample: Boxes show the 25\textsuperscript{th} and 75\textsuperscript{th} percentiles; whiskers show the 5\textsuperscript{th} and 95\textsuperscript{th} percentiles, respectively. Rhombuses show the mean. Blue and red bars represent the vertical difference in carbon intensity at the household level, i.e., the difference between the highest and the lowest median carbon intensity across quintiles. Red (blue) bars indicate that richer households consume less (more) carbon-intensively at the median than poorer households. Figure \ref{fig:Quint} shows the distribution of carbon intensities for all expenditure quintiles across all countries in our sample. We rank countries from bottom left to top right by the median carbon intensity in the poorest quintile. Note the different x-axes in the different panels.
    \end{subcaption2}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:fig_1} shows that within-quintile heterogeneity exceeds between-quintile heterogeneity in \textit{all} countries. This highlights the fact that analyses that rely on differences in income to explain differences in the carbon intensity of consumption (or the impact of climate policy) may be inadequate because they do not account for differences in carbon intensity at similar income levels. Instead, we suggest including household-level characteristics beyond income in such analyses to provide a more nuanced description of which households' consumption is particularly carbon-intensive.

This is also warranted because within-quintile differences may \textit{vary} across quintiles. To facilitate the comparison of vertical and horizontal differences across countries, we abstract from comparisons between all income groups (as in Equations \ref{eq_V} and \ref{eq_H}) and introduce two coefficients \autocite{Missbach.2024}\footnote{Many approaches are plausible for assessing and comparing heterogeneity within and across expenditure quintiles. For example, \textcite{Cronin.2019} examine the standard deviation of additional costs.}: The \textit{vertical distribution coefficient} $\widehat{V_{r}}$ compares the median carbon intensity of the poorest (\textit{q1}) and richest expenditure quintiles (\textit{q5}):

\begin{equation}
    \widehat{V_{r}} = \frac{\overline{e_{q1}}}{\overline{e_{q5}}}
\end{equation}

If the median carbon intensity of poorer households exceeds (is less than) the median carbon intensity of richer households, then $\widehat{V_{r}}>1$ ($\widehat{V_{r}}<1$) and climate policy would likely lead to regressive (progressive) outcomes.

The \textit{horizontal distribution coefficient} $\widehat{H_{r}}$ compares within-quintile differences (expressed as the difference between the 5\textsuperscript{th} and the 95\textsuperscript{th} percentile within quintiles) of the poorest and the richest expenditure quintiles:

\begin{equation}
    \widehat{H_{r}} = \frac{e_{q1}^{95} - e_{q1}^{5}}{e_{q5}^{95} - e_{q5}^{5}}
\end{equation}

$\widehat{H_{r}}>1$ ($\widehat{H_{r}}<1$) would indicate that within-quintile differences are greater (smaller) for poorer than for richer households, with implications for the effectiveness of compensation measures differentiated by household income.

\subsection{Analysis of heterogeneity in carbon intensity} \label{sec:methods}

Figure \ref{fig:fig_1} shows that horizontal heterogeneity in carbon intensity is consistently greater than vertical heterogeneity. This implies that differences in household income cannot explain all the differences in households' carbon intensity. In response, we analyze the relationship between $e_{i}$, the carbon intensity of household \textit{i}, and observable household characteristics $X_{i}^{'}$, including but not limited to total household expenditures. We assume that such a relationship exists, i.e., that differences in $X_{i}^{'}$ are meaningful for explaining differences in $e_{i}$:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:relationship}
    X_{i}^{'} \sim e_{i} 
\end{equation}

% Which criteria should be included in modelling and why?
% Discuss main arguments for single characteristics (possibly already in methods section).

To shed light on which household characteristics are correlated with, and possibly lead to, higher carbon intensity of consumption, we build on two analytical approaches, namely boosted regression trees (BRT) and a logit model.

\paragraph{Boosted regression trees (BRT)} Fitting boosted regression trees \autocite{Friedman.2003, Elith.2008} is a supervised machine learning method that allows detection of non-linear relationships and interaction effects between an outcome and many predictor variables (\textit{features}). As an extension to regression trees, the BRT algorithm (\texttt{XGBoost} by \textcite{Chen.2016}) fits many individual regression trees, iteratively giving higher weights to observations with larger prediction errors. This results in high predictive power, even compared to the popular random forest algorithm \autocite[e.g.,][]{Bentejac.2021}.

% Why BRT is helpful here.
Drawing on BRT serves the purpose of our analysis because it is a priori ambiguous which variables warrant inclusion in our model. In addition, research suggests that the impacts of climate policy (and thus the carbon intensity of consumption) are distributed non-linearly across households with different characteristics, such as income, demographic groups \autocite{Missbach.2023}, energy use \autocite{Farrell.2017}, and location \autocite{Chan.2023}. Unlike other approaches, such as variance-based inequality decomposition \autocite{Farrell.2017,Sager.2019,Missbach.2024}, fitting BRT is well suited to help identify important predictors while accounting for non-linear relationships and interaction effects between variables.

We fit BRT models at the country level to examine characteristics associated with heterogeneous levels of carbon intensity within individual countries. Carbon intensity $e_{i}$ is the outcome variable. For each country-level model, we use the full (\textit{rich}) set of household-level characteristics $X_{i}^{'}$ as possible features and perform several feature engineering steps (see also Appendix \ref{sec:featureengineering}). In addition, we include only total household expenditures as a single feature for prediction in a \textit{sparse} model. Comparing sparse and rich models helps to distill the contribution of additional features in explaining horizontal heterogeneity, i.e., heterogeneity that cannot be explained by heterogeneity in income. Table \ref{tab:features} documents all the features used to predict $e_{i}$.

\input{2_Tables/Table_Feature_Overview}

The predictive performance of BRT models depends critically on several hyperparameters. For hyperparameter tuning, we use fivefold cross-validation on each country-level subset of the data; we fit 1,000 trees -- following the recommendations of \textcite{Elith.2008} -- along with 30 different combinations of learning rate, maximum depth of trees, and fraction of features contained in each tree\footnote{We combine different values for learning rate ($\eta \in [0.001,0.3]$), maximum depth of trees (\texttt{max\_depth} $\in \{x \in \mathbb{N} \mid 3  \leq x \leq 15 \}$), and fraction of features contained in each tree (\texttt{mtry} $\in \{0.5,0.7,1\}$). We select randomized combinations of hyperparameters such that the combinations are evenly distributed across the possible combination space using the function \texttt{grid\_latin\_hypercube()} from the \textit{tidymodels} package in R. We show the resulting combination of hyperparameters in Table \ref{tab:C9}.}. For each country, we select the combination of hyperparameters that minimizes the mean absolute error (MAE).

Based on our selected hyperparameters, we use fivefold cross-validation for model evaluation. We evaluate model performance using MAE, root mean squared error (RMSE), and goodness of fit (R\textsuperscript{2}). 

We also use all observations to evaluate the relative importance of each feature using SHAP values \autocite{Lundberg.2017}: Expressed in the unit of the outcome variable, SHAP values represent the contribution of each feature to each individual prediction. SHAP values have been proposed as a more appropriate means of interpreting machine learning models compared to other approaches because of improved accuracy, consistency, and interpretability \autocite{Lundberg.2020}. Based on the SHAP values for all features and individual predictions, we calculate the average absolute SHAP value for each feature across all predictions, which can be interpreted as \textit{feature importance}. Higher average SHAP values indicate that differences in a feature contribute more to the prediction of the outcome variable. We express feature importance as a share of contribution (in \% of total average absolute SHAP values) to allow for better comparability of feature importance across countries. In addition, we visualize the distribution of SHAP values for the most important features in each country over feature values using partial dependence plots. 

\paragraph{Logit model} For supplementary robustness analyses, we fit a logit model to identify households whose consumption is substantially more carbon-intensive than the population as a whole. We construct a binary variable $e_{i}^{80^{th}}$ for each household \textit{i} indicating whether the household is among the most carbon-intensive 20\% of households in each country, i.e., in the top quintile of carbon intensity:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:logit}
    e_{i}^{80^{th}} =
    \begin{cases}
    1, & \text{for }  e_{i} \geq e^{80} \\
    0, & \text{for }  e_{i} < e^{80}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

With $P_{e_{i}^{80}}$ representing the probability that the consumption of household \textit{i} is more carbon-intensive than 80\% of the population in each country, we are interested in the coefficients $\beta^{'}$ of the following logit model:

\begin{equation} \label{logit}
    log \left( \frac{P_{e_{i}^{80}}}{1 - P_{e_{i}^{80}}} \right) = \alpha_{0} + \beta^{'} X_{i}^{'} + \varepsilon_{i}
\end{equation}

Estimation of a logit model serves as a robustness check for results from BRT models. It also allows for the examination of characteristics associated with "hardship case" households, including an accessible interpretation of results and parameters. For the purpose of meaningful comparison across countries, we present results from logit models using average marginal effects for each independent variable.

\paragraph{Identification of country clusters} Country-level analyses can be useful to identify country-specific household characteristics that are associated with higher carbon intensity of consumption. To explore similarities and differences in the importance of characteristics across many countries, we seek to identify clusters of countries. 

The relationship between household-level characteristics and carbon intensity of consumption is unique to each country, but also depends on the availability of granular data. We adjust for the importance of individual features by multiplying the importance of individual features and the country-level goodness of fit (R\textsuperscript{2}) to account for differences in available features across countries (see also Figure \subref{fig:data_visualisation_3}). This approach also helps to account for the aggregate performance of country-level models and allows for the better comparison of feature importance across countries. Our resulting measure of feature importance thus accounts for the contribution of individual features to explaining \textit{observed} values of carbon intensity rather than \textit{predicted} values of carbon intensity.

Based on the (adjusted) feature importance for each country, we use the k-means algorithm for clustering. If features are missing in the data, we assume that their share of contribution is zero\footnote{As a robustness check, we replace missing entries with the average values of all non-missing values. We use adjusted feature importance, i.e., we assume that the (imputed) contribution of unobserved features does not have a strong correlation with observed features.}. We normalize all feature values to allow for comparison between features. If a feature is more (less) important in one country compared to all other countries, the processed feature value will be relatively high (low). If a feature is equally important in all countries, the processed feature values will be close to zero. We also include vertical distribution coefficients $\widehat{V_{r}}$ for clustering because our measure of feature importance of household expenditures does not capture the \textit{direction} of effects.

K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method and helps to analyze clusters of observations that are most similar in many variables \textit{within} each cluster and least similar in many variables \textit{across} clusters \autocite{MacQueen.1967}. We examine the optimal number of clusters ($\{k \in \mathbb{N} \mid 3  \leq k \leq 20 \}$) using average silhouette widths \autocite{Rousseeuw.1987} for each cluster \textit{k}. The silhouette width $s_{i}$ expresses the average Euclidean distance of each observation \textit{i} to all other observations within its cluster and for the average distance to observations from the nearest neighboring cluster. Silhouette widths closer to $1$ indicate a good fit of an observation to its cluster, and silhouette widths closer to $-1$ indicate a poor fit. The average silhouette width $\overline{s_{k}}$ for each cluster \textit{k} expresses how well all observations fit, on average, into each cluster. Our approach yields $k = 6$ as the number of clusters that maximizes the average silhouette width\footnote{See Figures \subref{fig:G3_silhouette_2} and \subref{fig:G4_silhouette_2} for visualization.}. We also show the optimal number of clusters for k-means clustering based on unadjusted feature importance ($k = 5$) and on adjusted and imputed feature importance ($k=9$) in the Appendix\footnote{See Figures \subref{fig:G1_silhouette}, \subref{fig:G2_silhouette}, \subref{fig:G1_silhouette_3}, and \subref{fig:G2_silhouette_3} for visualization. Using unadjusted feature importance for clustering changes the interpretation of clusters: Features of countries within the same cluster contribute similarly to explaining variation in carbon intensity, regardless of the availability of features in the data and the explanatory power of the model.}.

Within the same cluster, individual features are similarly important in predicting households' carbon intensity. For each cluster, we compute averages for each feature to allow us to examine differences between countries in different clusters.%We also investigate which country is most likely to all other countries in each cluster maximizing silhouette width within each cluster and use it to demonstrate cluster-level characteristics. 

It is important to note that our approach of adjusting feature importance by overall predictive performance reduces the bias introduced by the limited availability of some features in the data at hand. Uncorrected feature importance values can be exaggerated when few features are available, so countries with few features may end up in the wrong cluster, mainly because the BRT model cannot help explain much of the variation in carbon intensity. Instead, our approach ensures that all \textit{observable} features contribute to clustering. Despite many structurally unobservable characteristics at the household level, our approach may be justified under the assumption that policy design can naturally focus only on observable household characteristics. This is particularly true for the design of compensation policies and when targeting errors are to be minimized.

\subsection{Methodological limitations}

While our approach can serve as a consistent method for studying heterogeneous impacts of climate policy, some methodological aspects are a limitation and thus warrant attention.

For example, the use of expenditure survey data is susceptible to many oft-described inaccuracies: Such data are prone to underreporting \autocite{Meyer.2015}, exclude the top end of the income distribution \autocite{Blanchet.2022}, and reflect consumer prices and policy regimes in the respective survey years. Our approach also neglects within-sector differences in the carbon intensity of consumption and relies on consumer price-dependent \textit{expenditures} to calculate household-level carbon intensity instead of the quality and quantity of consumption. This means that we systematically overlook the consumption of goods and services traded on informal markets, which may be justifiable, given that the additional costs of climate policy are most likely to occur through formal consumption.

Household-level expenditure data may also suffer from measurement error, which can affect the analysis of horizontal heterogeneity. Fortunately, our approach can address this concern, since the adjusted feature importance would be negligible if differences in expenditure shares between households were not correlated with differences in feature values, contrary to the assumption made in Proposition \ref{eq:relationship}.

Our approach allows for a consistent, harmonized analysis across countries, but falls short of accounting for the deployment of cleaner technologies since 2017. Yet, to our knowledge, more recent MRIO data with broad geographic coverage are not available. Also, our analysis may be well suited to informing about the immediate impacts of climate policy, but neglects medium-term effects that occur in general equilibrium\footnote{Including general equilibrium effects was found to lead to lower additional costs compared to short-term impacts \autocite{Ohlendorf.2021}.}. 

An important caveat is that our modeling approach does not lend itself to causal interpretation, particularly  because we are examining cross-sectional variation. Instead, we attempt to provide an accurate description of household characteristics that are correlated with households' carbon intensity, including non-linear relationships\footnote{For example, our analysis should not be read to imply that better education inevitably \textit{leads} to a lower carbon intensity of consumption, but rather that households that consume less carbon-intensively are often better educated, controlling for other important predictors and interaction effects.}.

The collection of household-level data from different datasets makes it difficult to compare model results across countries because some features are missing in some countries. In response, we adjust the importance of features for model accuracy, but it cannot be concluded from our results that carbon intensity is unpredictable \textit{per se} when model accuracy is low. Some important features remain structurally unobserved by us, but not by governments or other actors interested in our results. For some countries, more nuanced data may therefore help to flesh out more comprehensive analyses.

The clustering of countries is subject to uncertainty and depends on the criteria used for clustering. Our approach of adjusting the importance of features helps to avoid that countries end up in a cluster simply because features are missing in the data. Nevertheless, if we had more information to observe or if we included different criteria, countries might end up in different clusters. Arguing that we include all relevant and available criteria while minimizing redundancy, clustering can be useful to identify similarities in divergence. As a robustness check, we impute missing values for feature importance with averages and show the resulting clusters in Figures \subref{fig:fig_4_1_imputed} and \subref{fig:fig_4_2_imputed}.

\section{Results: Determinants of heterogeneous carbon intensity of consumption} \label{sec:results}

Climate policy can lead to short-term costs that are unevenly distributed across the population, depending on the heterogeneity in the carbon intensity of consumption at the household level. Identifying household characteristics (including total household expenditures) that correlate with households' carbon intensity helps to understand this heterogeneity. In the following, we compare the vertical and horizontal distributional effects of climate policy across countries and policy instruments with different regional and sectoral coverage. In addition, we analyze a set of household characteristics and their importance in predicting households' carbon intensity. We compare the importance of features across countries and assign countries to clusters accordingly.

\paragraph{Vertical and horizontal distributional effects}

We start by analyzing the vertical and horizontal distributional effects of climate policy using country-level distribution coefficients that express differences between the poorest and richest quintiles. Figure \ref{fig:fig_2} shows that the average carbon intensity of consumption in the poorest quintile is greater than in the richest quintile ($\widehat{V_{r}}>1$) in 44 out of 88 countries. These countries are relatively more affluent than others, as evidenced by higher GDP per capita: We document $\widehat{V_{r}}>1$ for all 20 countries in our sample with the highest GDP per capita. In such comparatively richer countries, climate policy is likely to have regressive effects. In contrast, the average carbon intensity of the richest quintile is higher than that of the poorest quintile ($\widehat{V_{r}}<1$) in 18 of the 20 countries with the lowest GDP per capita in our sample. In such comparatively poorer countries, climate policy is likely to have progressive effects. Both findings are consistent with inverted U-shaped Engel curves for carbon-intensive goods and services across countries and income quintiles \autocite{Dorband.2019}. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]

    \caption{Vertical and horizontal distribution coefficients}
    \label{fig:fig_2}
    \begin{subcaption2}
    The vertical distribution coefficient (y-axis) compares the median carbon intensity of the richest and poorest quintiles. The horizontal distribution coefficient (x-axis) compares the within-quintile differences (5\textsuperscript{th} to 95\textsuperscript{th} percentiles within quintiles) of the richest and poorest quintiles. Rectangles (A) and (B) indicate higher carbon intensity (at the median) in the poorest quintile compared to the richest quintile; rectangles (C) and (D) indicate lower carbon intensity (at the median) in the poorest quintile compared to the richest quintile. Rectangles (A) and (C) indicate smaller within-quintile differences in carbon intensity among the poorest quintile compared to the richest quintile; rectangles (B) and (D) indicate larger within-quintile differences in carbon intensity among the poorest quintile compared to the richest quintile. Point colors indicate GDP per capita for 2018 (in log-transformed constant 2010 USD). Table \ref{tab:A7} lists both distribution coefficients for all countries and also shows an alternative measure for $\widehat{H_{r}}$, i.e., comparing the difference between the 20\textsuperscript{th} and 80\textsuperscript{th} within-quintile percentiles for the poorest and the richest quintiles.
    \end{subcaption2}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:fig_2} also shows that within-quintile heterogeneity in carbon intensity is greater in the poorest quintile than in the richest quintile ($\widehat{V_{r}}>1$) in 60 out of 88 countries. This implies a more heterogeneous distribution of costs among poorer households, especially in richer countries, where climate policy is also more likely to be regressive. The comparison of the two distribution coefficients also shows that differences in horizontal heterogeneity between quintiles exceed vertical differences, i.e., between-quintile heterogeneity, in 68 countries. This reinforces the need for a detailed examination of household characteristics associated with higher carbon intensity of consumption beyond differences in household income.

\paragraph{Comparison of climate policy instruments with different sectoral and regional coverage}

Our analysis in Figure \ref{fig:fig_2} describes the distributional effects of climate policy instruments that lead to marginal increases in the price of national CO\textsubscript{2} emissions across all sectors. In essence, climate policy is likely to be more regressive in richer countries and more progressive in poorer countries. Heterogeneity is often greater among poorer households than among richer households, but in general the distributional effects of climate policy appear to depend on country-level circumstances. Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:comparison_policies} and Table \ref{tab:A14} show that such distributional effects are also policy-specific, i.e., they differ for policy instruments with different regional or sectoral coverage.

For example, policy instruments that lead to marginal price increases for global CO\textsubscript{2} emissions, such as border carbon adjustment \autocite[e.g.,][]{Mehling.2019,Cosbey.2019}, would lead to increasing heterogeneity among richer households relative to poorer households in 58 countries because richer households tend to spend relatively more on imported goods and services. For transport sector policies, we document more carbon-intensive consumption among richer households compared to poorer households in 59 countries, while differences in horizontal heterogeneity exceed vertical differences in 79 countries. In contrast, electricity sector policies are likely to affect poorer households more in 62 countries, with greater horizontal heterogeneity among poorer households in 65 countries. 

Comparing the coefficients for vertical and horizontal distributional effects across countries and for policy instruments with different regional and sectoral coverage shows that the distributional impacts of climate policy are country- and policy-specific. This implies that governments may prefer some climate policies over others because of distributional concerns, irrespective of the compensation measures available.

\paragraph{Analysis of heterogeneity: Model accuracy} 
By analyzing whether household characteristics help explain variation in carbon intensity, we can learn whether compensation policies can effectively compensate households for additional costs. We are thus interested in model accuracy as an important metric\footnote{Specifically, goodness of fit (R\textsuperscript{2}) has a convenient interpretation. Assume that governments would choose a set of transfers that, on average, equalizes relative additional costs. The goodness of fit then indicates the maximum possible reduction in horizontal heterogeneity in \% compared to the policy impact without compensation.}. If a model is good at predicting households' carbon intensity based on household characteristics, governments may be more likely to compensate households with high accuracy based on important features. 

% Sparse models: Total household expenditures only is insufficient
We show that variation in total household expenditures alone is often insufficient to predict households' carbon intensity with high accuracy. On average, the goodness of fit (R\textsuperscript{2}) accumulates to 4\% for \textit{sparse} BRT models including only total household expenditures (see Figure \ref{fig:comparison} or Table \ref{tab:A8}). In 79 countries, such sparse models contribute to explaining no more than 10\% of the variation in carbon intensity. This implies that compensation measures based on household expenditures, such as uniform or differentiated cash transfers, but also reductions in consumption taxes, would prove ineffective in compensating households with the highest additional costs.

% Rich models: Performance increases and predictive power is usually sufficient or acceptable
In contrast, our analyses suggest that including additional features increases model accuracy. On average, R\textsuperscript{2} is 23\% for \textit{rich} BRT models that include many features in addition to total household expenditures. The accuracy of rich models increases substantially compared to sparse models, for example from 3\% to 59\% (R\textsuperscript{2}) in the case of Jordan. Overall, rich BRT models help to predict households' carbon intensity with reasonable accuracy in many countries. Rich models' R\textsuperscript{2} accumulates to 59\% for Jordan, 53\% for Peru, and 52\% for Niger, and exceeds 30\% in 27 countries (Table \ref{tab:A8}).

% In some countries, however, predictive power is low which is an interesting finding
For some countries, however, the accuracy of rich models is comparatively low. In 17 countries, R\textsuperscript{2} does not exceed 10\%. Model accuracy is lowest in Bulgaria (1\%), Estonia, Hungary, and Suriname (3\%). One reason is that model performance depends critically on data granularity. In cases of low accuracy, our models are limited to relying on a few available features, such as household expenditures, sub-national area identifiers, household size, or education of the household head. Nevertheless, low model accuracy implies that in some countries it is difficult to infer about households' carbon intensity from observable characteristics, including total household expenditures. In Bulgaria, for example, vertical differences are small ($\widehat{V}_{r}^{1}=0.92$) and horizontal differences within expenditure quintiles are comparatively large ($\widehat{H}_{r}^{1}=1.29$, see also Figure \subref{fig:Quint_B}). Moreover, as our analysis confirms, within-quintile variation in total household expenditures is largely uncorrelated with variation in carbon intensity, providing additional motivation to analyze heterogeneity in policy impacts beyond (vertical) differences in affluence.

\paragraph{Country-level feature importance}
% Features are not equally important across countries
The importance of features in predicting variation in carbon intensity differs across countries. Figure \ref{fig:fig_4} and Table \ref{tab:A10} show the adjusted feature importance for all features in each country, our vertical distribution coefficient, mean CO\textsubscript{2} intensity, and R\textsuperscript{2}, grouped by country clusters\footnote{See Table \ref{tab:A10_Uncorrected} and Figure \subref{fig:fig_4_2_uncorrected} for the unadjusted feature importance for all features in each country. See Table \ref{tab:A10_Imputed} and Figure \subref{fig:fig_4_imputed} for the adjusted and imputed feature importance for all features in each country.}. While examining feature importance helps to identify features that explain the heterogeneity in carbon intensity, we also consider the contribution to the predicted outcomes for different feature values, as visualized for each country in supplementary partial dependence plots (see Figure \ref{fig:5b}).

% Household expenditures.
Without adjusting for model accuracy, the most important feature across countries is total household expenditures, with a relative contribution of 22\% on average. Household expenditures is the single most important feature for prediction in 33 countries, and in some countries, such as \hyperref[fig:5b_LUX]{Luxembourg} and \hyperref[fig:5b_HRV]{Croatia}, differences in household expenditures contribute more than 50\% to model prediction. Adjusting for model accuracy, household expenditures contributes most to prediction in \hyperref[fig:5b_PER]{Peru} (18\%), \hyperref[fig:5b_ECU]{Ecuador} (14\%), and \hyperref[fig:5b_IRQ]{Iraq} (14\%) -- countries in which we also consistently find higher carbon intensities for poorer households compared to richer households. The relationship between household expenditures and carbon intensity is non-linear, but overall decreasing for 52 countries, overall increasing for 13 countries, following an inverted U-shape for 11 countries and a U-shape for six countries (see Figure \ref{fig:5b}). We find strictly decreasing relationships between household expenditures and carbon intensity for 17 of the 20 countries with the highest GDP per capita, lending credibility to our descriptive analysis of vertical and horizontal distributional effects. In such countries, more carbon-intensively consuming households spend \textit{absolutely less} on consumption, but \textit{relatively more} on carbon-intensive goods and services.

% Motorcycle and car ownership
Motorcycle and car ownership is the most important feature in 15 and 13 countries, respectively. In \hyperref[fig:5b_BFA]{Burkina Faso}, \hyperref[fig:5b_NER]{Niger}, and \hyperref[fig:5b_TGO]{Togo}, variation in motorcycle ownership accounts for more than 20\% of the variation in carbon intensity. Car ownership accounts for the largest adjusted feature importance in \hyperref[fig:5b_JOR]{Jordan} (32\%) and \hyperref[fig:5b_TWN]{Taiwan} (18\%). On average, vehicle ownership is the most important feature across all countries and features \textit{including} adjustment for model performance. Vehicle ownership can be a strong predictor of climate policy costs in some countries: Households that own motorcycles or cars are more likely to consume more carbon-intensively than households without such vehicles in every country in our sample. This is related to the propensity of vehicle-owning (and -using) households to consume relatively more transportation fuels than others.

% Space: urban/rural, district, province
Spatial features such as urban or rural location, state, province, or district of the household are the most important feature in 15 countries. For example, differentiating between urban and rural households contributes more than 40\% of the model prediction in countries such as \hyperref[fig:5b_ESP]{Spain}, \hyperref[fig:5b_CZE]{the Czech Republic}, and \hyperref[fig:5b_FRA]{France}. We find that urban households consume less carbon-intensively than rural households in 45 countries (such as \hyperref[fig:5b_BRA]{Brazil}, \hyperref[fig:5b_DEU]{Germany}, and \hyperref[fig:5b_NOR]{Norway}), and more carbon-intensively in 10 countries (such as \hyperref[fig:5b_MNG]{Mongolia}, \hyperref[fig:5b_PAK]{Pakistan}, and \hyperref[fig:5b_ROU]{Romania}). For \hyperref[fig:5b_MNG]{Mongolia}, where state of residence accounts for 9\% of the adjusted feature importance, we document that households in Western Mongolia or Ulaanbaatar consume more carbon-intensively than households in Central Mongolia or the Highlands. In \hyperref[fig:5b_JOR]{Jordan}, where department of residence accounts for an adjusted feature importance of 5\%, households in Al-Quesmah and Na'oor districts consume more carbon-intensively than households in other departments. Differences in carbon intensity across space suggest an important role for access to energy and transport infrastructure. In many cities, for example, households can choose between different modes of transport, including public transport, which may help to explain the lower carbon intensities of urban households in relatively richer countries. In poorer countries, however, living in urban areas may be associated with more carbon-intensive lifestyles, partly explained by better access to electricity and formal fuels. This may explain more carbon-intensive consumption in urban households in Mongolia, Pakistan, and Romania, where the data lack features describing energy access and that could account for differences between urban and rural households.

% Energy use
Information on energy use, such as the main fuels used for cooking, lighting, and heating, or electricity access and appliance ownership, is the most important feature in seven of the countries where such features are available. Main cooking fuel is an important feature in \hyperref[fig:5b_PER]{Peru} and \hyperref[fig:5b_NIC]{Nicaragua}, with an adjusted feature importance of 19\% and 15\%, respectively. In both countries, households that cook with LPG are substantially more carbon-intensively than households that cook predominantly with firewood, a pattern that is consistent across all countries in our sample where a non-negligible share of households use firewood or charcoal for cooking. This result is in line with our assumption of zero direct emissions from biomass, firewood, and charcoal because of informal markets and structural impediments to regulating (and taxing) emissions from these sources. The use of kerosene for lighting is associated with higher carbon intensity compared to electricity and other lighting sources in \hyperref[fig:5b_UGA]{Uganda}, \hyperref[fig:5b_RWA]{Rwanda}, and \hyperref[fig:5b_ETH]{Ethiopia} with an adjusted feature importance of 10\% for Uganda and 9\% for Rwanda. Information on heating fuels is available in only a few countries, but is the single most important feature in \hyperref[fig:5b_TUR]{Turkey} and \hyperref[fig:5b_ARM]{Armenia}. Here, carbon intensity is higher in households that heat with coal (\hyperref[fig:5b_TUR]{Turkey}) or natural gas (\hyperref[fig:5b_ARM]{Armenia}) than in households that heat with electricity. In other countries, such as the \hyperref[fig:5b_GBR]{United Kingdom}, \hyperref[fig:5b_BRA]{Brazil}, \hyperref[fig:5b_AUT]{Austria}, and \hyperref[fig:5b_URY]{Uruguay}, the adjusted feature importance of heating fuels accumulates to no more than 3.5\%.

% Electricity access and appliance ownership
Overall, electricity access is less frequently an important feature, contributing a maximum of 4\% of the adjusted feature importance in \hyperref[fig:5b_SEN]{Senegal}. In the majority of countries, the feature importance for electricity access is low, possibly because of overall high electricity access rates (e.g., \hyperref[fig:5b_VNM]{Vietnam} and the \hyperref[fig:5b_PHL]{Philippines}) or low electricity access rates (e.g., \hyperref[fig:5b_MWI]{Malawi} and \hyperref[fig:5b_LBR]{Liberia}, see Table \ref{tab:A1}) or low carbon intensity of the electricity sector (e.g., \hyperref[fig:5b_ETH]{Ethiopia} and \hyperref[fig:5b_KEN]{Kenya}, see Table \ref{tab:Electricity}).

% Appliance ownership
Instead, ownership of major household appliances (such as refrigerators, washing machines, and air conditioners) is the most important feature in \hyperref[fig:5b_CHE]{Switzerland} and the \hyperref[fig:5b_PHL]{Philippines}, accounting for 18\% of the adjusted feature performance in the Philippines. This is less surprising because appliance ownership is a more compelling, but incomplete, proxy for electricity \textit{use} than electricity \textit{access}.

% Sociodemographic features
Sociodemographic features such as education, gender, self-identified ethnicity, nationality or religion of the household head are the most important feature in three countries. In \hyperref[fig:5b_PRT]{Portugal}, for example, where household education accounts for 28\% of the model prediction, households with tertiary education have a higher carbon intensity than households with primary or secondary education. The adjusted feature importance for gender of household head is highest in \hyperref[fig:5b_TGO]{Togo} and \hyperref[fig:5b_BEN]{Benin}, where households with female household heads are found to consume less carbon-intensively. In \hyperref[fig:5b_ISR]{Israel}, households that identify as Muslim are found to consume more carbon-intensively than households that identify as Jewish. Israeli households that report a traditional, religious, or orthodox lifestyle consume more carbon-intensively than secular households. For 76 out of 88 countries, individual sociodemographic features do not exceed 3\% of the adjusted feature importance, indicating their relatively low relevance across countries for predicting differences in carbon intensity.

\paragraph{Identification of country clusters}

% What are important features to assign countries to different clusters?
% Discuss country clusters in general and data issues, idiosyncracy. For each country cluster, one could recommend specific policy actions. Taken up again in discussion section.
% Discuss how well do countries fit into clusters?
Countries are comparable with respect to features that are important in predicting differences in carbon intensity. Based on the adjusted importance of all features and the vertical distribution coefficient of countries, we identify six distinct clusters of countries. Within clusters, countries are more similar to each other than to countries in other clusters. 

It is worth noting that not all countries fit well into their clusters, as indicated by an average silhouette width of 0.29 (see Figures \subref{fig:G3_silhouette_2} and \subref{fig:G4_silhouette_2} and Tables \ref{tab:A10} and \ref{tab:A9}). In Cluster B, for example, the silhouette width is negative for five countries, indicating greater heterogeneity between countries or, more generally, idiosyncratic patterns. Under such circumstances, it may be more difficult to draw conclusions about the distributional impacts of climate policy from the experiences of other countries. 

% Introducing Figure 3
Clusters differ in the importance of individual features. Figure \ref{fig:fig_3} shows the relative importance of different features across clusters, after ordering the clusters by cluster size. 

% Cluster A
The largest cluster, Cluster A, comprises 50 countries (including the \hyperref[fig:5b_USA]{USA}, \hyperref[fig:5b_CAN]{Canada}, \hyperref[fig:5b_BRA]{Brazil}, and \hyperref[fig:5b_DEU]{Germany}). In countries in this cluster, our analysis shows more carbon-intensive consumption among relatively poorer households. Compared to other clusters, most features contribute relatively little to explaining variation in carbon intensity. For example, the average adjusted feature importance is 3.5\% for household expenditures, which is the most important feature across all 88 countries. More generally, countries in Cluster A have in common that it is difficult to predict households' carbon intensity with the available data. One reason is that we adjust the country-level feature importance for model performance, which influences the identification of country clusters. For example, 18 out of 18 countries with relatively low model performance (R\textsuperscript{2}\textless 10\%) appear in Cluster A. In particular, the data resolution may be insufficient and does not cover variables describing energy use (37 countries in this cluster lack information on main cooking fuels and 30 countries lack information on car ownership). Nevertheless, these results also point to highly idiosyncratic determinants of heterogeneous carbon intensity with important implications for policy design. This is because attempts to compensate on the basis of characteristics observable in our dataset (such as total household expenditures) will not be effective in compensating the households most affected by climate policy. This is also the case in countries where more granular information is available, such as Brazil, Colombia, Israel, Kenya, and the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, the impact of climate policy can be large, as evidenced by a comparably carbon-intensive consumption in countries such as Australia, the Czech Republic, Mongolia, and Poland. 

% Cluster B
Cluster B includes 16 countries (such as \hyperref[fig:5b_IDN]{Indonesia}, \hyperref[fig:5b_MEX]{Mexico}, the \hyperref[fig:5b_PHL]{Philippines}, and \hyperref[fig:5b_ZAF]{South Africa}) with relatively high average carbon intensity (0.91 kgCO\textsubscript{2}/USD on average). Within countries, differences in carbon intensity between poorer and richer households are relatively small, but richer households consume more carbon-intensively in all countries except Uruguay and Vietnam. Countries have in common that spatial information and appliance and car ownership are comparably important features. Compared to other clusters, countries are less similar to each other, expressed by an average silhouette width of -0.02. 

% Cluster C
Cluster C includes 11 countries (such as \hyperref[fig:5b_IND]{India}, \hyperref[fig:5b_NGA]{Nigeria}, and \hyperref[fig:5b_PAK]{Pakistan}) with comparatively less carbon-intensive consumption (0.39 kgCO\textsubscript{2}/USD on average). In countries in this cluster, the consumption of richer households is more carbon-intensive. Motorcycle ownership, spatial information, and sociodemographic characteristics are relatively more important than in other clusters, while the adjusted feature importance for household expenditures is 3.5\%, on average. It is striking that nine countries in Cluster C are among the 22, i.e., the quarter of countries in our sample with the lowest GDP per capita. Nine out of 17 countries in sub-Saharan Africa belong to Cluster C, although this information was not used for clustering. Instead, the clusters indicate heterogeneous patterns of energy use. One implication is that it may be inaccurate to infer the distributional impacts of climate policy in one country from the experience of other countries, where patterns of energy use may be different.

% Cluster D
Cluster D consists of six countries in Latin America (\hyperref[fig:5b_BOL]{Bolivia}, \hyperref[fig:5b_ECU]{Ecuador}, \hyperref[fig:5b_SLV]{El Salvador}, \hyperref[fig:5b_NIC]{Nicaragua}, \hyperref[fig:5b_PER]{Peru}, and \hyperref[fig:5b_PRY]{Paraguay}) and \hyperref[fig:5b_IRQ]{Iraq}. In this cluster, household expenditures, main cooking fuel, and car ownership stand out as important features compared to other clusters. 

% Cluster E
The countries in Cluster E (\hyperref[fig:5b_RWA]{Rwanda} and \hyperref[fig:5b_UGA]{Uganda}) differ from all other countries in that the variation in the main lighting fuel and spatial information is comparably relevant for predicting carbon intensity. In contrast, the main household heating fuel is a relatively important feature in the two countries in Cluster F (\hyperref[fig:5b_ARM]{Armenia} and \hyperref[fig:5b_TUR]{Turkey}). In addition, we observe that both clusters E and F include geographically neighboring countries\footnote{See also Figure \ref{fig:Map} for visualization.}.

% Offer synthesis
While our clustering approach is inherently stylized, it helps to highlight country-specific characteristics that correlate with (and contribute to) heterogeneous impacts of climate policy on households. Importantly, we provide evidence that differences in household expenditures are less determinant of households' carbon intensity than is often assumed. Features describing household energy use may be helpful predictors in some countries (e.g., in Clusters B, C, D, E, and F), but not necessarily in all countries. For example, in countries in Cluster A such as \hyperref[fig:5b_BRA]{Brazil}, \hyperref[fig:5b_URY]{Argentina}, and \hyperref[fig:5b_ETH]{Ethiopia}, where the predictive power of the models is relatively high, the main energy fuels contribute relatively little to the prediction.

'Spatial' includes normalized absolute SHAP values for province, district, and urban/rural identifiers. For vertical distribution, blue (red) colors indicate a lower (higher) median carbon intensity in the poorest quintile compared to the richest quintile. For average carbon intensity, blue (red) colors indicate a lower (higher) average carbon intensity across clusters. For goodness of fit (R\textsuperscript{2}), blue (red) colors indicate a lower (higher) predictive performance compared to other countries. Average carbon intensity and R\textsuperscript{2} are not explicitly used for clustering. We assign countries to six clusters using k-means clustering. We also show all values in Table \ref{tab:A9}.
    \end{subcaption2}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Robustness check: Direction of effects}
Results from BRT models can help us to understand the contribution of each feature to the prediction of carbon intensity. Moreover, such model results also indicate the (non-linear) relationships between feature values and carbon intensity, as visualized in partial dependence plots (Figure \ref{fig:5b}). Here, we build on supplementary analyses based on a logit model (see Figure \ref{fig:Logit_ME} and Equation \ref{eq:logit}) to discuss and support our findings on the direction of the effects and to allow for a more accessible comparison across countries.

In the majority of countries, increasing expenditures is associated with a lower probability of being a hardship case: Estimates are less than and statistically different from zero ($p\leq 5\%$) for 62 countries (Figure \subref{fig:Logit_ME_exp}). The estimates are positive and significant ($p\leq 5\%$) for 11 countries. By comparison, our analysis of vertical heterogeneity (i.e., between-quintile differences, see Figure \ref{fig:fig_2}) yields progressive results in 44 countries. Thus, in some countries, poorer households may be more likely to consume more carbon-intensively than 80\% of the population, even though the overall distribution is progressive, again supporting our claim that a focus on vertical heterogeneity can be misleading.

Across countries, we document that owning (and using) a car (Figure \subref{fig:Logit_ME_car}) or motorcycle (Figure \subref{fig:Logit_ME_motorcycle}) is associated with a significant increase in the probability of consuming more carbon-intensively than 80\% of the population\footnote{The exception for car ownership is Ethiopia, where car ownership is associated with a \textit{decrease} of 14\% ($p=0.046$) in the probability of being in the most carbon-intensive quintile. However, our BRT model yields an unadjusted feature importance of 0.1\% for car ownership in \hyperref[fig:5b_ETH]{Ethiopia}. One reason for this is the comparatively small variation in car ownership in the Ethiopian data.}. In 11 countries, our estimates show a significantly ($p\leq 5\%$) higher probability of being in the most carbon-intensive quintile for urban households, but a lower probability in 33 countries compared to rural households (Figure \subref{fig:Logit_ME_urban}).

While the findings from logit models are generally in line with our results from BRT models, each model answers a slightly different question. In particular, models with binary dependent variables can be useful for analyzing distributional impacts because they help describe how parts of the population (e.g., the most carbon-intensive quintile) differ from other parts of the population\footnote{Supervised machine learning models are also well suited for analyzing variation in a binary dependent variable, i.e., classification problems.}. For example, for Mexico we find that differences in cooking fuel use account for 2\% of the adjusted feature importance for predicting carbon intensity, but cooking with coal instead of electricity is associated with a 43\% higher probability of consuming more carbon-intensively than 80\% of the Mexican population. Under such circumstances, addressing the use of (specific) cooking fuels may be warranted, even though the adjusted feature importance is comparatively low.

\paragraph{Robustness check: Alternative clustering}

Our preferred approach to clustering may place undue weight on missing information about feature importance. It is evident that countries in Cluster A have in common that many variables remain unobserved, especially on energy use. To address this shortcoming, we identify country clusters after imputing missing information for feature importance by feature-level averages. Supplementary Figure \subref{fig:fig_4_imputed} and Table \ref{tab:A10_Imputed} show the resulting clusters.

We identify nine alternative clusters. The largest cluster A\textsuperscript{1} contains 42 countries, including 37 countries that are part of Cluster A. Twelve countries that we identified as part of Cluster A in our preferred analysis end up in the second largest cluster, Cluster B\textsuperscript{1}, which contains 17 countries. The main differences between A\textsuperscript{1} and B\textsuperscript{1} are the adjusted feature importance for household expenditures which is higher for countries in Cluster B\textsuperscript{1} (8\%) than in Cluster A\textsuperscript{1} (3\%), and goodness of fit (R\textsuperscript{2}, 13\% and 23\%, respectively).

Cluster C\textsuperscript{1} includes countries where car ownership is an important predictor. Spatial information is similarly important in countries in Cluster D\textsuperscript{1}, and motorcycle ownership and sociodemographic characteristics are similarly important in countries in Cluster E\textsuperscript{1}. Identical to our main analysis, Rwanda and Uganda (Cluster F\textsuperscript{1}) and Armenia and Turkey (Cluster H\textsuperscript{1}) end up in a cluster because of lighting and heating fuels, respectively. Nicaragua and Peru (Cluster G\textsuperscript{1}) stand out because of the importance of cooking fuels, while the Philippines is relatively different from all other countries because of appliance ownership, which is an important predictor.

Overall, this alternative approach to clustering emphasizes the illustrative purpose of our clustering exercise. Clustering appears to be comparatively sensitive to unobserved features. This supports our conclusion that prevailing idiosyncratic patterns determine households' carbon intensity of consumption\footnote{For example, the average silhouette width decreases to 0.22 for our alternative clustering approach.}. In the search for effective compensation measures, governments may need to address both hidden information and structurally unobservable determinants that drive households' technology use.

\section{Discussion: Unpacking the policy toolbox} \label{sec:discussion}

% State findings
Our findings provide evidence for country-specific household characteristics associated with higher carbon intensity of consumption. These results can be useful in ex-ante assessments of climate policy to identify particularly affected household profiles and thus promising policies to compensate them. Both the persistence of horizontal heterogeneity and the identification of different country clusters suggest that commonly proposed compensation options, such as uniform lump-sum transfers, may not be effective in compensating the most carbon-intensive households in the context of each country. Moreover, most of the discourse on complementary compensation policies focuses on industrialized countries belonging to Cluster A, where, as we show, household characteristics associated with carbon-intensive consumption may differ substantially from countries in other clusters. For example, poorer households consume more carbon-intensively than richer households, and the observed heterogeneity in carbon intensity is difficult to predict, as indicated by an average goodness of fit of 13\%.

% Qualification: Why our discussion does not give concrete policy advice, but rather a guardrail
We refrain from proposing specific compensation policies for particular countries, and recognize that preferences for one measure over the other may be subject to many normative considerations at the government level, as described in Chapter \ref{sec:literature}. Admittedly, compensation becomes more feasible when climate policy builds on price-based interventions, such as carbon pricing or fossil fuel subsidy removal, thereby increasing the fiscal space to reimburse households. Moreover, a thorough comparison of alternative compensation policies should take into account existing institutions, potentially constrained government capacity, and the limited information available to policymakers. With these limitations in mind, we examine which options in the policy toolbox could be more effective in supporting those households that would bear the highest additional costs, thereby reducing horizontal heterogeneity\footnote{Our analysis can also shed light on \textit{existing} compensation policies for climate policy. Austria, for example, introduced a carbon price in 2022. Revenues are distributed back to the population as a lump-sum transfer. However, the size of the transfer varies across regions, with higher transfers in regions with less transport and health infrastructure \autocite{BMK.2023}. Our analysis for \hyperref[fig:5b_AUT]{Austria} shows that total household expenditures and spatial features account on average for 36\% and 18\% of the predicted values (R\textsuperscript{2}=0.21). Despite some remaining degree of unobserved heterogeneity and the lack of explicit differentiation of transfers with respect to primary heating fuels and car ownership, the compensation measures proposed by the Austrian government are likely to reduce horizontal heterogeneity.

In contrast, Canada introduced a nationwide carbon tax in 2019, with the proceeds going back to households through quarterly tax returns. Canadian households from rural regions receive an additional 10\% of the transfers to account for higher dependence on fossil fuels for transportation \autocite{GovernmentofCanada.2023}. In 2023, the Canadian government announced that it would exempt heating oil from carbon pricing for three years to reduce additional costs for poorer households in the Atlantic provinces, which are more likely to use oil for heating \autocite{Reuters.2023}. Our analysis for \hyperref[fig:5b_CAN]{Canada} shows that Canadian provinces account for 39\% of the predicted values (R\textsuperscript{2}=0.16), but that households from the Atlantic provinces are less likely to consume carbon-intensively than households from Saskatchewan and Ontario. Exempting heating oil from carbon pricing may be effective in reducing costs for carbon-intensively consuming households if heating fuels not included in our sample contribute substantially to unexplained heterogeneity. Nevertheless, our analysis shows that Canadian provinces appear to be a poor proxy for heating fuels, suggesting that households from the Atlantic provinces may perceive the carbon tax suspension as less relief than the government may have expected.}.

% Lump-sum transfers
\textit{Uniform lump-sum transfers}, potentially distributed equally per capita, are the poster child of many economists. Indeed, such transfers would be applicable if governments had a strong preference for reducing vertical inequality while avoiding regressive effects\footnote{In this case, \textcite{Stiglitz.2019} proposes sectorally differentiated regulation, depending on whether richer households disproportionately consume the respective goods and services. This could imply, for example, comparatively stricter intervention in the aviation sector, albeit with aggregate efficiency losses.} and ensuring high salience of compensation \autocite{Chetty.2009}. In contrast, research draws attention to the relatively low public acceptance of such transfers and the 'equity-pollution-dilemma'\footnote{Hypothetically, reimbursing households in proportion to their costs would minimize the distributional effects on aggregate, although it would partially offset the demand-side effects of the policy instrument because households would use (part of) their reimbursement to consume more carbon-intensive products \autocite[see also][]{Stiglitz.2019}.}\autocite{Sager.2019}.

Our analysis shows that uniform lump-sum transfers would be effective in reducing heterogeneous impacts of climate policy in countries where total household expenditures are an important feature and where disproportionately high costs would fall on relatively poorer households. Such transfers could be comparatively effective in reducing horizontal heterogeneity in countries in Cluster D, including Bolivia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Iraq, Nicaragua, and Peru. % Horizontal heterogeneity is large in some cases, possibly reducing precision.

% Targeted transfers to low-income households OR proportional transfers
Many governments have established \textit{cash transfer programs targeting low-income households}. Leveraging such existing institutions could be beneficial, even though targeting errors of cash transfer programs can be substantial \autocite{Banerjee.2022} and associated with lower public acceptability \autocite{Bah.2019}. Our results suggest that transfers targeting low-income households may be helpful where poorer households consume more carbon-intensively than richer households and where household expenditures are not an important feature. In our sample, this is the case for some Cluster A countries such as the Maldives, Poland, and Suriname.

% Tax breaks - labor income tax
The discipline has also popularized \textit{reducing distortionary taxes} to reap a 'double dividend' \autocite{Bovenberg.1996}. In addition, lowering income or consumption taxes provides leverage to counter vertical heterogeneity. For example, if richer households consume more carbon-intensively and household expenditures are an important feature, lowering the labor tax may be an effective offset. Indeed, in some Cluster C countries, such as Pakistan and Burkina Faso, reducing labor taxes may be useful for effective compensation while also promoting formalization \autocite{Jessen.2021,Rocha.2018} and economic activity \autocite{Ulyssea.2018}.

% Tax breaks - consumption tax
Beyond the benefits for aggregate efficiency, \textit{reducing excise taxes on consumption} may be effective in countries where poorer households consume more carbon-intensively and where total expenditures are an important feature, e.g., in Cluster D countries. In addition, differentiated tax reductions (e.g., through VAT) could shift consumption towards less carbon-intensive products \autocite{Klenert.2023}. Reducing excise taxes on basic consumer goods, including food and some forms of energy, may reduce vertical heterogeneity because poorer households spend a larger share of their expenditure share on such goods in most contexts\footnote{If informal consumption is more widespread, however, reducing consumption taxes may be less progressive \autocite{Bachas.2020}.}. 

% Addressing energy use through exemption of transition fuels, infrastructure access
Uniform lump-sum transfers and (income or consumption) tax cuts would likely fall short of compensating the most carbon-intensive households in countries with large horizontal heterogeneity and low predictive power for total household expenditures. In such circumstances, it may be important to \textit{enable access to low-carbon technologies}. This can help reduce the price elasticity of households and make it easier for households to consume less carbon-intensive goods and services. Where vehicle and appliance ownership is important, lowering technological barriers can be effective, for example through incentives for energy efficiency improvements, improved public transport systems, or investments in green mobility infrastructure. Such policies may be helpful in Cluster B countries such as Mexico and Costa Rica. % large initial investments required in transport and heating sector
The main cooking fuel is an important feature in some Cluster B and D countries. Here, subsidies for clean cookstoves or 'transition fuels' (such as LPG) may be effective. Exempting kerosene from regulation may be useful in Rwanda and Uganda (Cluster E), while addressing the heating sector through improvements in buildings may be helpful in Armenia and Turkey (Cluster F), where the main heating fuel is an important predictor. % Sketch examples?

% Low predictive power is an important result, feature not a bug
An important concern for effective compensation arises from the low model accuracy found for some countries. This implies that any transfer based on characteristics observable in our dataset will be ineffective in compensating the most carbon-intensive households and in reducing horizontal heterogeneity. In some countries, particularly in Cluster A, households' carbon intensity is difficult to predict, underscoring the importance of additional country- and policy-specific research, especially when governments face information problems \autocite{Mirrlees.1971}. In this case, reducing excise taxes on comparatively carbon-intensive goods could contain increasing heterogeneity while preserving incentives for supply-side abatement \autocite{Goulder.2008}.

% Policy design - different policy instruments
Addressing the distributional impacts of climate mitigation policy does not necessarily require considering different compensation options. Instead, policymakers can also turn to different types of regulation. As we show, increasing the marginal cost of global CO\textsubscript{2} emissions would lead to more heterogeneity among richer households. Transport sector policies would imply more progressive effects, but also greater horizontal heterogeneity in general. In contrast, electricity sector policies would lead to more regressive effects with greater heterogeneity among poorer households. While we refrain from investigating the importance of household characteristics in predicting the outcomes of such policies for now, our results highlight that addressing unintended distributional impacts may also have implications for the choice of climate policy instruments, albeit with implications for aggregate efficiency and revenue collection. 

% Design of non-price-based instruments
The interpretation of our findings is relatively straightforward for price-based policies. Nevertheless, our approach can also inform the design of standards, mandates, or subsidies, depending on how such policies affect the marginal cost of CO\textsubscript{2} emissions. However, distributional impacts may be less salient for such instruments, and potential compensation would also be more difficult to finance because of foregone revenues. %Non-pricing interventions can be helpful, in case they change preferences or address technological path-dependencies.

% Methodological considerations
Our analysis provides a foundation for more comprehensive analyses using more nuanced data. Such additional research can explicitly address inaccuracies in our modeling approach, including uncertainties about the supply-side pass-through of cost increases, technological path dependencies, and information frictions. Admittedly, our work is also silent on the heterogeneous impacts of climate policy in terms of potential co-benefits \autocite[e.g.,][]{Holland.2019,Karlsson.2020}, co-costs \autocite[e.g.,][]{Fuje.2019,Greve.2022}, wealth \autocite[e.g.,][]{Fullerton.2011}, and labor \autocite[e.g.,][]{Castellanos.2024}. Instead, this study provides information on the first-order distributional impacts of climate policy on consumption costs, which may be useful for identifying potential demand for compensation and ultimately for increasing public acceptance. Clustering countries according to how the costs of climate policy are distributed across the population demonstrates that some compensation policies would work more effectively in some countries than in others, potentially limiting the scope for cross-country learning. % Labour may require additional compensation measures, such as subsidzing low-skilled labour in carbon-intensive sectors.

% Further research: Value chain of climate policy implementation. Welfare function of policymakers or winning coalition not clear.
The distributional impacts of welfare-enhancing policy proposals are important not only for welfare analyses, but also for understanding the political economy of climate policy. While this study provides a comprehensive assessment of such distributional impacts for climate policy, it is less clear how the distribution of costs translates into public \textit{acceptance}. It is often argued that people prefer progressive outcomes because of equity reasons, but large horizontal heterogeneity, subjective beliefs \autocite{Douenne.2020}, and scattered perceptions of fairness \autocite{MaestreAndres.2019,Povitkina.2021} cast doubt on this assumption. Future research could contribute to a better understanding of how the (expected) distribution of costs affects public acceptance of climate policy. Similarly, some policy instruments and complementary compensation measures may be more acceptable to the public than others, but research providing theory and empirical evidence remains scarce \autocite[e.g.,][]{Sommer.2022,Valencia.2023}, at least compared to the literature quantifying distributional impacts. 

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

% Methodological contribution
This study is the first to provide a detailed analysis of the heterogeneous impacts of climate policy on households across a large number of countries. Our flexible framework, which integrates multi-regional input-output data with detailed household expenditure data, allows for the analysis of country- and policy-specific impacts. We used supervised machine learning to identify household characteristics that help explain variation in the carbon intensity of consumption at the country level.

% Core contribution: Horizontal inequality is neglected.
Our results show that differences in total household expenditures can be important in explaining such variation. However, focusing solely on differences in household expenditures misses important parts of the picture. Rather, horizontal heterogeneity outweighs vertical heterogeneity, and models based on household expenditures are comparatively less accurate. The analysis of heterogeneous outcomes of climate policy requires the inclusion of additional, often neglected household characteristics, such as information on energy use, vehicle and appliance ownership, location, or sociodemographic characteristics.

% Empirical analysis - what we show instead.
For each country, we quantified the contribution of individual features and showed that their relative importance varies compared to other countries. Using k-means clustering, we identified six country clusters with comparable distributional characteristics.

Our results suggest that the heterogeneous impacts of climate policy are country- and policy-specific. In some countries, it is difficult to predict the costs of climate policy based on available household characteristics. This implies that it may be difficult to address vertical and, in particular, horizontal distributional effects of climate policy with commonly proposed measures such as uniform lump-sum transfers. Instead, we identified complementary compensation policies that can help governments more effectively ease the unintended distributional effects of climate policy. This may be an important prerequisite for efficient, yet politically acceptable climate change mitigation.

\section{Data cleaning} \label{sec:cleaning}

We describe our approach to collecting, cleaning and harmonizing microdata, and to feature engineering for machine learning analyses.

\subsection{Collecting household data}\label{sec:cleaning_1}

We collect household budget survey data and extract several information before cleaning and harmonizing. Household budget survey data are often publicly available, but sometimes subject to a considerable fee. Table \ref{tab:datasets} provides publishing organizations, names of surveys, and links to datasets used in this study.

\begin{itemize}
    \item For each household, we include sociodemographic information about household members where available. In all survey, households are represented through 'household heads', i.e., persons that often contribute the largest share of household income or are responsible for purchase decisions. We use information on the 'household head' as a proxy for the entire household and collect information on education, gender, self-identified ethnicity, nationality, or religion of the 'household head'. We standardize information on education by using the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to facilitate comparison across countries.
    \item We include spatial information where available, for example identifier for sub-national areas (provinces or states), sub-sub-national areas (districts) or villages. Often, surveys include an indicator for whether households live in urban or rural areas. Definitions of \textit{urban} and \textit{rural} may not be consistent across countries, but are certainly consistent within countries.
    \item We include information on energy use, such as on primary fuels used for cooking, lighting, and heating. We harmonize information on fuels across countries to account for different names and levels of detail across countries. For example, cooking fuels include charcoal, coal, electricity, firewood, gas, kerosene, liquid fuel, LPG, other biomass, or unknown fuels.
    \item We capture information on electricity access and create a binary variable that indicates if households have access to electricity through electricity grids, through generators, or solar panels. 
    \item We collect information about ownership of major transport vehicles (such as cars, motorcycles, and trucks) and major household appliances (such as refrigerators, air conditioners, washing machines, and television). For each country, we only include information about ownership, but not about the precise number of owned vehicles and appliances. This helps improve consistency across countries.
    \item We collect all available information on household-level expenditures, integrating information from household-level and individual-level diary entries. We do not include consumption information from home production, received as gifts, or as remuneration for labor. Our rationale is that it would be difficult for a climate policy instrument to cover self-produced goods and services that are not purchased on markets. We include all expenditures at the item level and extrapolate expenditures to yearly values. Often, households track expenditures over the course of a few weeks, but provide details on less frequent purchases in the past months or year. For more frequently purchased items, mostly food, this approach neglects seasonal consumption patterns, but resulting bias should be sufficiently small, since households are surveyed throughout the year.
    \item We do not include imputed expenditures, for example, for hypothetical rental payments, since including them would inaccurately overestimate total household expenditures and bias expenditure shares towards less carbon-intensive services.
\end{itemize}

Code written for each country-level dataset can be found in a stable online repository (see Appendix \ref{code}).

\subsection{Cleaning and harmonizing household data}\label{sec:cleaning_2}

Building on collected microdata from household budget surveys we perform several cleaning steps in order to harmonize datasets across countries as far as possible. Conditional on country-level data availability, we ensure that we clean all available data consistently. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item We remove households from the sample with missing information for key variables such as household size, sampling weights, or total expenditures.
    \item We code and treat missing information about other variables as missing or 'unknown' and remove variables for each country, if missing information are dominant.
    \item For each country, we address outliers of household expenditures at the item level. We consider any observation an outlier if it is in the 99\textsuperscript{th} percentile of all non-zero expenditures. We replace this observation with item-level median expenditures, thereby assuming that expenditure shares on such items are non-zero, but absolute values might have been exaggerated because of misreporting.
    \item We remove observations, if expenditures are negative, for example, because households sell items.
    \item We remove duplicates from our sample. We check separately for duplicates at the level of household information and at the level of expenditures on individual consumption items: We consider households spending the same amount of money on the same items duplicates.
    \item We remove all households from our sample if aggregate expenditures exceed mean aggregate expenditures by five standard deviations ($z>5$).
    \item We use inflation rates from \textcite{IMF.2020} and exchange rates from the \textcite{WorldBankGroup.2023} to convert all local currencies to USD for the year 2017. Expenditures from surveys conducted before 2017 are inflated; expenditures from surveys after 2017 are deflated. This ensures consistency with calculated sectoral CO\textsubscript{2} intensities as they refer to the year 2017. This approach does however neglect that expenditure shares may change with rising incomes and inflation. Adjustment for purchasing power parity (PPP) is not necessary because we refrain from comparing households across countries.
    \item We create matching tables to assign country-level expenditure items to 65 aggregate sectors and to four broad expenditure categories (energy, food, goods, services). Items, that are difficult to match to a specific sector or to a specific category, for example, 'other expenses', are matched to artificial sectors and categories labeled 'other'. Admittedly, we assume a carbon intensity of zero for such items in absence of more detailed information, but expenditure shares are generally low (0.7\% on average across country-level averages). 
    \item We delete observations for items indicating aggregate categories if this would lead to double-counting of single expenditures. We delete observations for items indicating taxes (e.g., 'property tax'), since including them would prove inaccurate to calculating expenditure shares and because items indicating tax payments are not available in each country.
    \item We match items pertaining to fuels such as firewood, charcoal, and other biomass to the sector \textit{lumber} to account for indirect emissions attributable to production, transportation, and retail of these goods. However, we treat direct CO\textsubscript{2} emissions of such fuels as zero, in line with assumptions by the IPCC \autocite{Grad.2023}, but also because direct emissions of such fuels are often difficult to regulate.
    \item We also identify items indicating energy use and create separate variables listing expenditures for different energy items such as electricity, gasoline, diesel, kerosene, LPG, natural gas, charcoal, hard coal, firewood, and other biomass. All matching tables are available through a separate stable online repository (see Appendix \ref{code}).
\end{itemize}

This procedure helps ensuring that sectoral expenditure shares are comparable across countries, even though not all surveys include information on the same number and detail of consumption items. We proceed with assigning households to expenditure quintiles based on total household expenditures per capita to account for differing expenditure shares in larger households. We use expenditure quintiles for our analyses in figures \ref{fig:fig_1} and \ref{fig:Quint}.

Tables \ref{tab:A1}, \ref{tab:A2}, \ref{tab:A3}, \ref{tab:A4_CF}, \ref{tab:A5_LF} and \ref{tab:A6} show summary statistics for our final harmonized dataset, grouped by country and by country and expenditure quintile in tables \ref{tab:A2} and \ref{tab:A3}. 

% tracking and documenting removals

\subsection{Feature engineering} \label{sec:featureengineering}

Based on our harmonized dataset, we perform feature engineering on our variables (features) with the \texttt{R}-package \texttt{recipes} before performing analyses with BRT.

\begin{itemize}
    \item We exclude any feature with missing variation (for four countries).
    \item We exclude categorical feature with extremely high granularity (such as district-level identifiers) or no granularity (such as education, in some cases).
    \item We exclude any feature with missing values.
    \item We remove the minimum number of features necessary to avoid high levels of correlation ($r>0.9$) between all features.
    \item We code observations as "other" for each feature (except province-level, district-level and urban/rural identifiers) that account for less than 5\% of all observations.
    \item All country-level feature sets include total household expenditures (in USD 2017) and household size. The minimum number of included features (including binary, categorical, and continuous features) is 4 (for Sweden) and the maximum number of included features is 17 (for Benin, Burkina Faso, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, and Togo).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Policy simulation}\label{sec:policysimulation}

We show that heterogeneity in the carbon intensity of consumption at the household level is equivalent to heterogeneity in household-level costs of climate policy, assuming that such instruments increase marginal costs of emitting CO\textsubscript{2} and that producers pass on such costs to consumers. This analysis thus disregards general-equilibrium-effects on both the supply- and the demand-side. In general, any climate policy instrument is conceivable in this exercise that leads to increasing costs in equivalence to embedded direct and indirect emissions, including (but not limited to) carbon pricing, fossil fuel subsidy removal, or subsidies for low-carbon fuels.

The carbon intensity of consumption $e_{i}$ consists of sectoral carbon intensities and household-level sectoral expenditure shares as shown in equation \ref{eq:ei}. 

For example, consider the case of carbon pricing, which can be thought as a tax $\tau$ in USD/tCO\textsubscript{2}. The total absolute costs from carbon pricing equals direct and indirect carbon emissions embedded in household consumption $E_{i}$ multiplied with $\tau$. Computing total relative costs $c_{i}$ requires division by total household expenditures $C_{i}$:

\begin{equation}
    c_{i} = \frac{E_{i}*\tau}{C_{i}}
\end{equation}

Relative additional costs, i.e., the carbon pricing incidence $c_{i}$ can be expressed in \%, i.e., the fraction of absolute additional costs ($USD_{\tau}$) over total household expenditures ($USD_{i}$). $c_{i}$ is equivalent to our expression for carbon intensity of consumption $e_{i}$, scaled by a proportional factor $\tau$. If $e_{A}=2*e_{B}$, then $c_{A}=2*c_{B}$, assuming that $e_{A}$ and $e_{B}$ express the carbon intensity covering all nationally released CO\textsubscript{2} emissions for households \textit{A} and \textit{B} and that $c_{A}$ and $c_{B}$ refer to the relative carbon pricing incidence for a carbon price levied on all nationally released emissions in households \textit{A} and \textit{B}, respectively. In essence, heterogeneity in carbon intensity is equivalent to heterogeneity in household-level costs of climate policy instruments, under assumptions about how such instruments affect the marginal costs of emitting CO\textsubscript{2}.

In general, our modeling framework also allows for the simulation of other (sectoral) policies. Consider a carbon-tax-equivalent policy intervention in a specific sector, for example, in the transport sector, here denoted as $\tau_{s^{*}}$. Such a sector-specific tax would cover all direct and indirect emissions released in this sector $s^{*}$, but not emissions released in other sectors. Nevertheless, customer prices of goods and services from sectors other than transport would still increase because of embedded emissions from the transport sector.

Calculating additional sets of sectoral carbon intensities $e_{s^{*}}$ including direct and indirect emissions of different sectors can help simulate the impact of sectoral policies. Effectively, we only include direct and indirect CO\textsubscript{2} emissions released in sectors $s^{*}$.

It is also possible to analyze the distribution of regional policies, for example of carbon border taxes covering CO\textsubscript{2} emissions for imported goods and services. 

Supplementary figure \ref{fig:comparison_policies} shows vertical and horizontal distribution coefficients for the national carbon intensity in all sectors, in the transport sector, in the electricity sector and for the international carbon intensity in all sectors. See also table \ref{tab:A14}.
