  \caption{Features and feature groups used to predict carbon intensity of consumption}
  \label{tab:features}

\begin{subcaption2}
This table shows features and corresponding feature groups used to predict carbon intensity of consumption. All sociodemographic features refer to self-identified information of individuals. Column 'Countries' refers to the number of countries with non-missing information for each feature. For some countries, we have removed some features for prediction because of unreasonably high (e.g. \textit{District}) or no resolution (e.g. \textit{Education}). See also Appendix \ref{sec:cleaning} for further information about features.
