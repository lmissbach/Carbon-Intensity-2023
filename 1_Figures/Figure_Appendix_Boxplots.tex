  \begin{subcaption2}
    This figure displays the distribution of carbon intensity of consumption in kgCO$_{2}$/USD (x-axis) over expenditure quintiles (y-axis) for 30 countries. The first expenditure quintile comprises those 20\% of all households with least total expenditures per capita. The fifth expenditure quintile comprises those 20\% of all households with largest expenditures per capita. Within quintiles, boxes display the 25\textsuperscript{th} and the 75\textsuperscript{th} percentile; whiskers display the 5\textsuperscript{th} and 95\textsuperscript{th} percentile; rhombuses indicate the within-quintile average. Vertical coloured bands indicate the difference between the highest and the lowest quintile-level median carbon intensity of consumption. Blue bands indicate higher carbon intensities among richer households; red bands indicate higher carbon intensities among poorer households. See also Tables \ref{tab:A3} and \ref{tab:A7}.

  \begin{subcaption2}
    This figure displays the distribution of carbon intensity of consumption in kgCO$_{2}$/USD (x-axis) over expenditure quintiles (y-axis) for 27 countries. The first expenditure quintile comprises those 20\% of all households with least total expenditures per capita. The fifth expenditure quintile comprises those 20\% of all households with largest expenditures per capita. Within quintiles, boxes display the 25\textsuperscript{th} and the 75\textsuperscript{th} percentile; whiskers display the 5\textsuperscript{th} and 95\textsuperscript{th} percentile; rhombuses indicate the within-quintile average.
