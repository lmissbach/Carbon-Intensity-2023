  \begin{subcaption2}
     This figure shows average marginal effects of 1\% increase in total household expenditures on the probability of consuming more carbon-intensively than 80\% of households in each country. Estimates come from logit models (see equation \ref{logit}) including a rich set of control variables. Control variables differ for different countries. Red points display negative estimates; blue points display positive estimates. Error bars display the 95\%-confidence interval. Estimates are ordered in descending order.
